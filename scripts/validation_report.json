The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis.

By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design. This technique will be complemented with ultrafast spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or a gas analyzer, and computer simulation. The gas detection generated by SPR will be compared with GC-MS to establish an experimental relationship between simultaneous temperature and gas detection in SPR imaging. Ultra-fast measurements and computer simulations, incorporating advanced physics and chemistry models, will be employed to observe how rapidly these materials generate gas. The measurements will monitor the process from extremely brief moments to longer durations. This will enhance our understanding of heat transfer through the material, which is essential for improving process efficiency. The research outcome will be significant as it allows simultaneous measurement of temperature and gas generation from nanoparticles, providing a direct relationship between thermal energy and hydrogen generation. It will clarify the primary mechanism in enhanced hydrogen generation. This technique has applications in various fields, including clean energy, medicine, and chemical processes. The project aligns well with DOE Basic Energy Science priorities and will leverage the existing capabilities at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC) and the state-of-the-art facilities at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), preparing the project team thoroughly for this research. This collaboration holds great potential for new discoveries in how light interacts with materials to produce chemical reactions like hydrogen production. The project will foster a constructive partnership between TAMU-CC and SNL, aiding TAMU-CC, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) in the Coastal Bend region of South Texas, in expanding its research capabilities in fundamental science. Students, a post-graduate researcher, and the lead scientist will benefit from access to cutting-edge equipment and the opportunity to exchange ideas with experts in the field."

In particular, the discovery that titanium oxide (TiO2) photocatalyzes the dissociation of water has triggered broad interest and intensive studies of water adsorption on TiO2 over decades. However, there is still limited information on the interfaces of TiO2 with liquid water and aqueous solutions, which are the relevant systems in most practical applications. The main goal of this project is to obtain a comprehensive picture of the surfaces and aqueous interfaces of TiO2 through first principles-based simulations, as this understanding can also help improve the ability to control their properties and those of other oxide interfaces as well. Specific systems/processes to be investigated in this renewal project include: the aqueous interface of amorphous TiO2, a widely used coating material in biomedical engineering and electrochemistry; carboxylic acid adsorption on TiO2 surfaces from dilute solution, one of the most common processes used for the functionalization of TiO2 and other metal oxide surfaces; the hydration structure of iridium oxide, which is widely considered as the current state-of-the-art anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction; and electron transfer across the aqueous interfaces of wide band gap oxides, a process affecting the production of H2 in water radiolysis. Our approach is based on quantum mechanical simulations combined with enhanced sampling and machine learning techniques, which allow us to model systems and phenomena spanning a wide range of size and time scales through accurate yet computationally efficient interatomic potentials based on deep neural networks.",

          "public_abstract": "Understanding Surfaces and Interfaces of (Photo-)catalytic Oxide Materials with First Principles Theory and Simulations Annabella Selloni Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08544 The interaction of water with metal oxide surfaces is of fundamental importance in various scientific fields and applications, ranging from geochemistry and (photo-)catalysis to biomedical devices. In particular, the discovery that titanium oxide (TiO2) photocatalyzes the dissociation of water has triggered broad interest and intensive studies of water adsorption on TiO2 over decades. However, there is still limited information on the interfaces of TiO2 with liquid water and aqueous solutions, which are the relevant systems in most practical applications. The main goal of this project is to obtain a comprehensive picture of the surfaces and aqueous interfaces of TiO2 through first principles-based simulations, as this understanding can also help improve the ability to control their properties and those of other oxide interfaces as well. Specific systems/processes to be investigated in this renewal project include: the aqueous interface of amorphous TiO2, a widely used coating material in biomedical engineering and electrochemistry; carboxylic acid adsorption on TiO2 surfaces from dilute solution, one of the most common processes used for the functionalization of TiO2 and other metal oxide surfaces; the hydration structure of iridium oxide, which is widely considered as the current state-of-the-art anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction; and electron transfer across the aqueous interfaces of wide band gap oxides, a process affecting the production of H2 in water radiolysis. Our approach is based on quantum mechanical simulations combined with enhanced sampling and machine learning techniques, which allow us to model systems and phenomena spanning a wide range of size and time scales through accurate yet computationally efficient interatomic potentials based on deep neural networks."

Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design. This technique will be complemented with ultrafast spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or a gas analyzer, and computer simulation. The gas detection generated by SPR will be compared with GC-MS to establish an experimental relationship between simultaneous temperature and gas detection in SPR imaging. Ultra-fast measurements and computer simulations, incorporating advanced physics and chemistry models, will be employed to observe how rapidly these materials generate gas. The measurements will monitor the process from extremely brief moments to longer durations. This will enhance our understanding of heat transfer through the material, which is essential for improving process efficiency. The research outcome will be significant as it allows simultaneous measurement of temperature and gas generation from nanoparticles, providing a direct relationship between thermal energy and hydrogen generation.

Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design. This technique will be complemented with ultrafast spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or a gas analyzer, and computer simulation. The gas detection generated by SPR will be compared with GC-MS to establish an experimental relationship between simultaneous temperature and gas detection in SPR imaging. Ultra-fast measurements and computer simulations, incorporating advanced physics and chemistry models, will be employed to observe how rapidly these materials generate gas. The measurements will monitor the process from extremely brief moments to longer durations. This will enhance our understanding of heat transfer through the material, which is essential for improving process efficiency. The research outcome will be significant as it allows simultaneous measurement of temperature and gas generation from nanoparticles, providing a direct relationship between thermal energy and hydrogen generation. It will clarify the primary mechanism in enhanced hydrogen generation. This technique has applications in various fields, including clean energy, medicine, and chemical processes",

This collaboration holds great potential for new discoveries in how light interacts with materials to produce chemical reactions like hydrogen production. The project will foster a constructive partnership between TAMU-CC and SNL, aiding TAMU-CC, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) in the Coastal Bend region of South Texas, in expanding its research capabilities in fundamental science.

A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design.

          "public_abstract": "Scientists are developing a method to efficiently produce hydrogen fuel from water using special photocatalyst materials that harness sunlight. Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design. This technique will be complemented with ultrafast spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or a gas analyzer, and computer simulation.

It will clarify the primary mechanism in enhanced hydrogen generation. This technique has applications in various fields, including clean energy, medicine, and chemical processes. The project aligns well with DOE Basic Energy Science priorities and will leverage the existing capabilities at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC) and the state-of-the-art facilities at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), preparing the project team thoroughly for this research. This collaboration holds great potential for new discoveries in how light interacts with materials to produce chemical reactions like hydrogen production. The project will foster a constructive partnership between TAMU-CC and SNL, aiding TAMU-CC, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) in the Coastal Bend region of South Texas, in expanding its research capabilities in fundamental science. Students, a post-graduate researcher, and the lead scientist will benefit from access to cutting-edge equipment and the opportunity to exchange ideas with experts in the field."

Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel.

          "public_abstract": "Semiconductor nanomaterials, including 2D nanosheets and microscopic single crystals have important technological applications ranging from fuel production to electrosynthesis. The photocatalytic activity is known to be highly heterogeneous both in an ensemble of nanomaterials and within a single particle. Despite significant research activity, the understanding of photocatalytic heterogeneity remains incomplete. We propose to use nanoelectrochemical techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to carry out quantitative, spatially resolved photoelectrochemical experiments aimed at measuring photo(electro)catalytic activity and characterizing heterogeneity of a wide range of semiconductor nanomaterials. We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis.

These molecular changes happen when the electrons that surround the molecule\u2019s nuclei absorb the light at a million times faster than a trillionth of a second, inducing nuclear motion. This motion modifies the molecules resulting in different chemical behavior or the formation of new molecules. These processes are at the heart of ultrafast chemistry. To perform these experiments, a microscope of unprecedented power, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) at SLAC National Laboratory, acts as a high-repetition rate strobe light. This X-ray laser freezes the motion of atoms, a frame at a time, to capture high-speed images of ultrafast microscopic chemical transformations, enabling the production of a molecular movie. One planned experiment will use the upgraded ultrafast LCLS-II X-rays and instrumentation to image UV-induced breaking of water molecules with the utmost precision. This study is important for not only fundamental science in chemistry, physics and biology, but also various technologies. Specifically, the experiments will measure the motion of electrons as they move across the water bonds on an ultrafast timescale by probing and characterizing the motion of the oxygen and the two hydrogen atoms in the water molecule during the initial stages of ultrafast chemical reactions. The research includes powerful calculations to provide a quantitative interpretation of the results. This area of fundamental research is crucial to chemical sciences because it probes the dynamics of electrons and nuclei in molecules and determines how these dynamics influence the transfer of energy, charge, or protons, as well as chemical bond breaking or formation of new bonds that make new molecules. The knowledge acquired is foundational to controlling charge transfer and energy transfer from light to matter. This project will contribute new data to the research identified as new scientific opportunities in the 2018 BES Report, \u201cOpportunities for Basic Research at the Frontiers of X-ray FEL Ultrafast Science\u201d and fall within the Priority Research Opportunity (PRO1): \u201cProbing and controlling electron motion within a molecule\u201d. This research also supports the 2015 DOE Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee mission and report on \u201cChallenges at the Frontiers of Matter and Energy: Transformative Opportunities for Discovery Science\u201d."

However, the United States (US) faces significant challenges: many graduating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, enter the workforce without the necessary skills, hands-on experience, and research expertise in AI and HPC. The lack of adequately trained graduates impedes the nation\u2019s ability to drive innovation and achieve strategic objectives. To address the challenges, this project aims to build a regional AI community through collaborative research and traineeship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to provide students with comprehensive training in AI with HPC, equipping them with the technical expertise and practical experience needed to excel in these fields. This project has seven key objectives: (i) Establish a regional community for sustainable traineeship collaboration between Maryland institutions and the DOE lab, including shared infrastructure, cross-mentored research projects, and integrated educational resources; (ii) Train and prepare students for the future AI workforce by providing students with hands-on research experience with DOE Lab\u2019s AI projects, fostering practical skills, expertise in real-world applications, and the ability to collaborate effectively within team settings; (iii) Provide students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research projects, guided by experienced faculty and DOE scientists; (iv) Facilitate students\u2019 professional development through workshops, seminars, hackathons, and training sessions that equip students with the latest AI technologies, industry-standard tools, and ethical considerations; (v) Enhance course contents and design new course modules at the participating institutions to reflect the latest advancements in AI and incorporate practical experiences that align with industry needs; (vi) Recruit and support students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field and ensuring a wide range of perspectives in AI development; (vii) Establish long-term research collaborations between students, faculty, and DOE scientists to address critical AI challenges and advance scientific knowledge. This project is anticipated to mentor and support around 27 students over three years. Working in teams, students will collaborate with scientists at LBNL, contributing to studies that advance AI and HPC. The student participants will receive comprehensive financial support throughout the academic year and summer. Faculty and DOE scientists will hold regular mentoring meetings with student research teams. The curriculum at the participating institutions will be improved through collaboration with LBNL scientists, integrating state-of-the-art research and projects to better prepare students for careers in the AI workforce. This sustainable model ensures the long-term continuation of AI education excellence, aligning with the evolving needs in AI and HPC, as well as the DOE\u2019s mission. This project\u2019s broad impacts will contribute to preparing a highly skilled workforce in AI to ensure that the U.S. maintains its global leadership.

Working collaboratively, this project seeks to increase the number of historically underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields while broadening the understanding of solar driven chemical reactions. The project will strengthen the research and scientific opportunities at the three MSIs in collaboration with ANL and provide 12 students annually opportunities to engage in high-impact research focused on questions surrounding artificial and biohybrid photosynthesis. Through a year-round training program, weekly group meetings, and an annual week-long full group meeting at ANL, participants will be provided with ample networking opportunities, culturally responsive mentoring, and professional development. By engaging students in a collaborative research project and culturally responsive mentoring, faculty will work to improve the sociocultural environment and remove obstacles for the advancement of a diverse workforce in the photochemical sciences. This project builds on complementary techniques to understand and improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for solar fuel production. Nickel and cobalt molecular catalysts offer a promising opportunity for the development of new materials for solar fuel production as they are inexpensive, readily synthesized, and can be chemically modified to tune their properties. Computational modeling techniques will be utilized to understand the effect of structural changes on the catalysts. These results will aid in the design of improved biohybrid systems. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy will be utilized to characterize the charge-transfer events and electronic structure of the transition metal complexes and the biohybrid complexes.

However, the United States (US) faces significant challenges: many graduating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, enter the workforce without the necessary skills, hands-on experience, and research expertise in AI and HPC. The lack of adequately trained graduates impedes the nation\u2019s ability to drive innovation and achieve strategic objectives. To address the challenges, this project aims to build a regional AI community through collaborative research and traineeship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to provide students with comprehensive training in AI with HPC, equipping them with the technical expertise and practical experience needed to excel in these fields. This project has seven key objectives: (i) Establish a regional community for sustainable traineeship collaboration between Maryland institutions and the DOE lab, including shared infrastructure, cross-mentored research projects, and integrated educational resources; (ii) Train and prepare students for the future AI workforce by providing students with hands-on research experience with DOE Lab\u2019s AI projects, fostering practical skills, expertise in real-world applications, and the ability to collaborate effectively within team settings; (iii) Provide students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research projects, guided by experienced faculty and DOE scientists; (iv) Facilitate students\u2019 professional development through workshops, seminars, hackathons, and training sessions that equip students with the latest AI technologies, industry-standard tools, and ethical considerations; (v) Enhance course contents and design new course modules at the participating institutions to reflect the latest advancements in AI and incorporate practical experiences that align with industry needs; (vi) Recruit and support students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field and ensuring a wide range of perspectives in AI development; (vii) Establish long-term research collaborations between students, faculty, and DOE scientists to address critical AI challenges and advance scientific knowledge. This project is anticipated to mentor and support around 27 students over three years. Working in teams, students will collaborate with scientists at LBNL, contributing to studies that advance AI and HPC. The student participants will receive comprehensive financial support throughout the academic year and summer. Faculty and DOE scientists will hold regular mentoring meetings with student research teams. The curriculum at the participating institutions will be improved through collaboration with LBNL scientists, integrating state-of-the-art research and projects to better prepare students for careers in the AI workforce. This sustainable model ensures the long-term continuation of AI education excellence, aligning with the evolving needs in AI and HPC, as well as the DOE\u2019s mission.

However, there is a limited participation of minority students in nuclear physics research due to the lack of financial support during the academic year. Therefore, this proposal seeks to enhance the participation of minority undergraduate students in nuclear science by providing financial stability throughout the whole year which allows them to concentrate on their research. The GSU nuclear physics group is working on several research projects at the forefront of nuclear physics. These projects are carried out at national facilities (i.e. Brookhaven National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and National Institute of Standards and Technology) as well as locally, and include building the hadronic calorimeter for the sPHENIX experiment, carrying data analysis on the data collected by the PHENIX detector, building and designing modular RICH Aerogel prototype of particle identification detector for Electron-Ion Collider experiments, and building and running cosmic ray detector units. In addition, there are also near future projects such as sPHENIX and NSR experiments. The breadth of these research projects and the GSU group\u2019s experience in mentoring undergraduate and graduate student work, especially with women and minorities provide excellent research opportunities for the students to learn valuable skills utilized in all aspects of research including detector construction, data collection and analysis, and dissemination."

However, the United States (US) faces significant challenges: many graduating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, enter the workforce without the necessary skills, hands-on experience, and research expertise in AI and HPC. The lack of adequately trained graduates impedes the nation\u2019s ability to drive innovation and achieve strategic objectives. To address the challenges, this project aims to build a regional AI community through collaborative research and traineeship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to provide students with comprehensive training in AI with HPC, equipping them with the technical expertise and practical experience needed to excel in these fields. This project has seven key objectives: (i) Establish a regional community for sustainable traineeship collaboration between Maryland institutions and the DOE lab, including shared infrastructure, cross-mentored research projects, and integrated educational resources; (ii) Train and prepare students for the future AI workforce by providing students with hands-on research experience with DOE Lab\u2019s AI projects, fostering practical skills, expertise in real-world applications, and the ability to collaborate effectively within team settings; (iii) Provide students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research projects, guided by experienced faculty and DOE scientists; (iv) Facilitate students\u2019 professional development through workshops, seminars, hackathons, and training sessions that equip students with the latest AI technologies, industry-standard tools, and ethical considerations; (v) Enhance course contents and design new course modules at the participating institutions to reflect the latest advancements in AI and incorporate practical experiences that align with industry needs; (vi) Recruit and support students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field and ensuring a wide range of perspectives in AI development; (vii) Establish long-term research collaborations between students, faculty, and DOE scientists to address critical AI challenges and advance scientific knowledge. This project is anticipated to mentor and support around 27 students over three years. Working in teams, students will collaborate with scientists at LBNL, contributing to studies that advance AI and HPC. The student participants will receive comprehensive financial support throughout the academic year and summer. Faculty and DOE scientists will hold regular mentoring meetings with student research teams. The curriculum at the participating institutions will be improved through collaboration with LBNL scientists, integrating state-of-the-art research and projects to better prepare students for careers in the AI workforce. This sustainable model ensures the long-term continuation of AI education excellence, aligning with the evolving needs in AI and HPC, as well as the DOE\u2019s mission.

Working collaboratively, this project seeks to increase the number of historically underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields while broadening the understanding of solar driven chemical reactions. The project will strengthen the research and scientific opportunities at the three MSIs in collaboration with ANL and provide 12 students annually opportunities to engage in high-impact research focused on questions surrounding artificial and biohybrid photosynthesis. Through a year-round training program, weekly group meetings, and an annual week-long full group meeting at ANL, participants will be provided with ample networking opportunities, culturally responsive mentoring, and professional development. By engaging students in a collaborative research project and culturally responsive mentoring, faculty will work to improve the sociocultural environment and remove obstacles for the advancement of a diverse workforce in the photochemical sciences. This project builds on complementary techniques to understand and improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for solar fuel production. Nickel and cobalt molecular catalysts offer a promising opportunity for the development of new materials for solar fuel production as they are inexpensive, readily synthesized, and can be chemically modified to tune their properties. Computational modeling techniques will be utilized to understand the effect of structural changes on the catalysts. These results will aid in the design of improved biohybrid systems. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy will be utilized to characterize the charge-transfer events and electronic structure of the transition metal complexes and the biohybrid complexes. It is anticipated that the dual approach of an immersive inter-institutional research experience and culturally responsive mentoring as a means of effecting systemic change to support a diverse group of participants will lead to higher retention and persistence of a more diverse workforce.

The project builds foundations for research and training in Accelerator Research and Development (R&D) through a new partnership model and through supporting research and training applications that include project elements aimed at directly addressing barriers to participation through innovative recruiting and retain strategies focused on individuals from diverse backgrounds with clear and measurable outcomes. The goals of the project are: 1. Recruiting a total of 24 STEM students; mentoring and teaching the recruited students one-on-one and through workshops, seminars, and specific scientific and engineering courses; and training the recruited students through a ten-week summer hands-on training program at BNL during each summer of the project; 2. Developing and offering three new courses in the Accelerator Science and Technology (AST) and a new Academic Minor in AST under the umbrella of the Electrical Engineering Technology program; 3. Conducting research in Accelerator Science and Technology alongside the ASTD scientists and engineers through a carefully designed summer program. The scope of the proposed research is aligned with the goals the Office of Science Program at DOE, in general, and the RENEW program in particular. The proposed project is an ice-breaker for students and faculty at City Tech, as well as colleagues at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Additionally, the STEM curriculum and research arena at City Tech is approached from a new perspective, with new opportunities offered to students to deeply immerse themselves into a very applied field, shaping their careers very efficiently. The rather broad approach of the academic field is forced now into a very narrow field, allowing the students to gain extensive experience that would otherwise take a very long time to achieve. The proposed novel educational model, which bridges academia with the science labs, and the work/research results will be disseminated to the community via presentations in conferences, papers published in peer reviewed journals, project website at City Tech and BNL, seminars, and open house events. The project benefits the Department of Energy by giving it the opportunity to offer long term collaboration prospects to the best performing students in the field of Accelerators R&D from a diverse population of highly trained STEM students."

Working collaboratively, this project seeks to increase the number of historically underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields while broadening the understanding of solar driven chemical reactions. The project will strengthen the research and scientific opportunities at the three MSIs in collaboration with ANL and provide 12 students annually opportunities to engage in high-impact research focused on questions surrounding artificial and biohybrid photosynthesis. Through a year-round training program, weekly group meetings, and an annual week-long full group meeting at ANL, participants will be provided with ample networking opportunities, culturally responsive mentoring, and professional development. By engaging students in a collaborative research project and culturally responsive mentoring, faculty will work to improve the sociocultural environment and remove obstacles for the advancement of a diverse workforce in the photochemical sciences. This project builds on complementary techniques to understand and improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for solar fuel production. Nickel and cobalt molecular catalysts offer a promising opportunity for the development of new materials for solar fuel production as they are inexpensive, readily synthesized, and can be chemically modified to tune their properties. Computational modeling techniques will be utilized to understand the effect of structural changes on the catalysts. These results will aid in the design of improved biohybrid systems.

Working collaboratively, this project seeks to increase the number of historically underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields while broadening the understanding of solar driven chemical reactions. The project will strengthen the research and scientific opportunities at the three MSIs in collaboration with ANL and provide 12 students annually opportunities to engage in high-impact research focused on questions surrounding artificial and biohybrid photosynthesis. Through a year-round training program, weekly group meetings, and an annual week-long full group meeting at ANL, participants will be provided with ample networking opportunities, culturally responsive mentoring, and professional development. By engaging students in a collaborative research project and culturally responsive mentoring, faculty will work to improve the sociocultural environment and remove obstacles for the advancement of a diverse workforce in the photochemical sciences. This project builds on complementary techniques to understand and improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for solar fuel production. Nickel and cobalt molecular catalysts offer a promising opportunity for the development of new materials for solar fuel production as they are inexpensive, readily synthesized, and can be chemically modified to tune their properties. Computational modeling techniques will be utilized to understand the effect of structural changes on the catalysts. These results will aid in the design of improved biohybrid systems. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy will be utilized to characterize the charge-transfer events and electronic structure of the transition metal complexes and the biohybrid complexes. It is anticipated that the dual approach of an immersive inter-institutional research experience and culturally responsive mentoring as a means of effecting systemic change to support a diverse group of participants will lead to higher retention and persistence of a more diverse workforce.

A reverse modeling strategy will be used to design an optimum test matrix. This framework will enable modeling and predicting ion-irradiated mechanical properties using reduced test data, thereby accelerating the development of novel High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) materials for beam window applications. Our research project will include nanoindentation testing and material characterization of several HEAs exposed to ion irradiation. Irradiated mechanical property prediction model and property correlation metamodels will be developed considering traditional and machine learning approaches. Extrapolation will be performed using a data superposition approach to predict the HEAs\u2019 material responses under higher irradiation conditions and the results will be validated against test data. The combined optimum testing matrix and robust modeling techniques will be used to help downselect suitable HEA compositions that are most resistant to beam-induced radiation and thermal shock damage. The development and selection of novel HEAs will ensure reliable operation and improved lifetime of beam windows in next-generation accelerator target facilities, such as the 2.4 megawatts Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility, that will support advancements in high-energy physics research."

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments.

Huang, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (Co-Investigator) J. Maxson, Cornell University (Co-Investigator) T. Hodgetts, RadiaBeam Technologies Co-Investigator) The ultra-compact X-ray free-electron lasers, or UC-XFEL, is a 5th generation light source \u2013 a coherent X-ray source based on high gradient accelerator technologies originally pioneered for exploring the high energy physics frontier. The UC-XFEL program has identified a pathway to obtain an X-ray FEL with a footprint and cost (<40 m including X-ray beamlines; <$35M) easily permitting distributed coherent X-ray FEL sources for research, medical, industrial and security applications. Interest is high in the approach, which is based on very high gradient electron RF gun sources and accelerators \u2013 both employing an emerging technique using cryogenic operation. In this cryo-RF approach, the sustainable electric fields are increased by over a factor of 2.5 over present technology. Together with the use of very short period magnetic undulators and novel compression methods creating intense femtosecond electron beams., this scheme permits the shrinking the length of the XFEL by an order-of-magnitude, while maintaining a highly capable, high-flux XFEL. The details of a fully realized 1 GeV design, aiming at a 1 nm operating wavelength, have been published in a highly cited article three years ago The UC-XFEL introduced continues to attract attention, due to the challenges of understanding the intricate technology and experimental approaches needed. Cryo-RF methods stand out for their potential wide range of applications, and a strong development effort to create new, more efficient and less costly designs continues apace in US laboratories. The key enabling part of the UC-XFEL scheme is the cryogenic RF photoinjector, which promises the needed 6D beam brightness, is under intense R&D at UCLA. Parallel, collaborative efforts on cryogenic photoemission and high field operation are currently underway. Likewise, development of the techniques needed for advanced imaging methods based on the UC-XFEL continues vigorously. A strong science case is emerging, with a particular demand for harder X-rays, to the Angstrom-level. In particular, the collaboration engaging the research under this proposal has been in close contact with representatives of the US semiconductor industry, which is interested in new, high-resolution metrology and inspection methods. The issues behind this are both technical and strategic; with continuing downsizing of chip critical dimensions, dramatically more capable metrology is needed. Recent impressive investments in the semiconductor sector made through the 2021 CHIPS Act underscore the importance of this work. Every new generation of chips present frontier challenges in the fabrication ecosystem, which are now at a level requiring serious research initiatives. One of the key hurdles to confront in advancing to the next level of chip performance is that of metrology \u2013 the need to measure extremely small features in a more robust way. Indeed, after a series of community studies coordinated by NIST, the critical challenge of metrology for next-gen chip manufacturing and validation was emphatically identified, with an urgent call to action described in a series of reports. While the needs for metrology in current chip architectures are adequately addressed by present methods, they will be obsolete soon, as they rely on a time-consuming and destructive process, involving the stepwise removal of chip layers. As such, these methods, and proposed extensions, are not qualified candidates for meeting the future demands of chip metrology. A much finer resolution, non-destructive, and orders-of-magnitude faster approach is demanded. We have studied such an approach, which is based on the technique of ptychographic laminography. This method has been tested at storage rings, and has given extremely promising results, showing zoom-capable imaging to sub-20 nm resolution, albeit at 60 hours needed per scan.

This design is now published in Instruments and, like its predecessor in the soft X-ray regime, it is attracting much attention. The program initiated in this work has been endorsed by Intel scientists, and future funding is being proposed through NIST as well as private investors. This proposed research in this grant is aimed at a comprehensive study of the conceptual design, with preliminary engineering and costing, of a UC-XFEL instrument which is fully capable of translational application to ptychographic laminography-based chip inspection. This effort is paired with a direct study of the performance and limitations of the UC-XFEL for this application. The success of this initiative may not only have a direct impact on a critical US industry, but also provide a powerful 3D imaging tool to characterize mesoscale materials such as high entropy alloys, aiding national security efforts. Indeed, chip metrology has a key importance for future economic security in this country through both inspection in fabrication, and validation of chips of untrusted provenance. This is amplified by the recent demonstration of a sudden and continuing rise of the critical role enabled by AI/ML in the modern economy, and the attendant needs for a renewed U.S. chip infrastructure."

A reverse modeling strategy will be used to design an optimum test matrix. This framework will enable modeling and predicting ion-irradiated mechanical properties using reduced test data, thereby accelerating the development of novel High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) materials for beam window applications. Our research project will include nanoindentation testing and material characterization of several HEAs exposed to ion irradiation. Irradiated mechanical property prediction model and property correlation metamodels will be developed considering traditional and machine learning approaches. Extrapolation will be performed using a data superposition approach to predict the HEAs\u2019 material responses under higher irradiation conditions and the results will be validated against test data. The combined optimum testing matrix and robust modeling techniques will be used to help downselect suitable HEA compositions that are most resistant to beam-induced radiation and thermal shock damage. The development and selection of novel HEAs will ensure reliable operation and improved lifetime of beam windows in next-generation accelerator target facilities, such as the 2.4 megawatts Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility, that will support advancements in high-energy physics research."

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments.

The alloys start with 1) high Z bulk LMs (e.g. Sn, Ga, In) as solute and 2) dissolve a minority segregation of low Z metals (e.g. Li, Be, Mg, Al, Si or Ca), and crucially 3) use a chemical dynamic to segregate the low Z member to the surface of the solvent. The sputtered material is low Z and sputtering of the high Z is strongly suppressed. The essential mechanism is known in metallurgy, but has never been recognized in the context of LM PFCs. It is the action of a very low concentration of a low Z non-metal (e.g. O, N, F, P, S etc. ) to segregate the more reactive low Z metal to the surface of the less reactive solute LM. As described below, this has very likely been the operative dynamic in past measurements of the only alloy heretofore considered in fusion, Sn70Li30 - but unrecognized. The new dynamic enables segregation of low Z elements in cases when surface tension effects are totally inadequate to cause this. (As in virtually all the examples above). New alloys will have properties that have a qualitative similarity to SnLi, but are quantitatively greatly improved: alloys will have low Z sputtering, much lower vapor pressure than Sn70Li30 and ability to operate at much higher temperature (by an estimated several 100's C), and in some cases, avoidance of the extremely strong increases in sputtering with temperature that is measured in present LM PFCs (Li, Sn, SnLi, Ga). We propose to experimentally test three examples of the alloys class above.",

A reverse modeling strategy will be used to design an optimum test matrix. This framework will enable modeling and predicting ion-irradiated mechanical properties using reduced test data, thereby accelerating the development of novel High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) materials for beam window applications. Our research project will include nanoindentation testing and material characterization of several HEAs exposed to ion irradiation. Irradiated mechanical property prediction model and property correlation metamodels will be developed considering traditional and machine learning approaches. Extrapolation will be performed using a data superposition approach to predict the HEAs\u2019 material responses under higher irradiation conditions and the results will be validated against test data. The combined optimum testing matrix and robust modeling techniques will be used to help downselect suitable HEA compositions that are most resistant to beam-induced radiation and thermal shock damage. The development and selection of novel HEAs will ensure reliable operation and improved lifetime of beam windows in next-generation accelerator target facilities, such as the 2.4 megawatts Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility, that will support advancements in high-energy physics research."

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments. The goal of the proposed research effort is the realization of new strategies for resisting hydrogen embrittlement at extreme temperatures.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions.

          "public_abstract": "Lattice instabilities and emergent collective phases and behavior rooted in the quantum world PI: Valeri Petkov, Department of Physics, Central Michigan University The remarkable properties of quantum materials result from strong interactions among their electronic, lattice and spin degrees of freedom and the rich variety of ordered electronic phases that emerge as a consequence, often in a close proximity to each other. If understood and controlled at atomic level, their properties could revolutionize virtually every aspect of science and technology. A fundamental feature of many quantum materials is the locally broken crystal symmetry and presence of lattice distortions due to lattice instabilities. The properties of such materials are difficult to understand because local lattice distortions are difficult to assess using traditional crystallographic techniques. This project aims to advance through fundamental research the atomic-level understanding of collective electronic phases and behavior emerging in quantum materials exhibiting local lattice distortions. Our hypothesis is that, in many quantum materials, lattice distortions are not induced by changes in the electronic structure but appear as an independent degree of freedom that bridges electronic phases the materials may exhibit. To verify the hypothesis, we will employ resonant total x-ray scattering coupled to atomic pair distribution function analysis and large-scale 3D modeling to study the interaction between lattice distortions, electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom in charge density wave and Mott insulating systems exhibiting competing superconducting, electronic and magnetic orders. Since emergent phenomena are very sensitive to external stimuli, we will study the interaction as important physical parameters such as temperature, chemical composition and/or magnetic field are varied in a controlled manner. An integral part of our effort is the further development of resonant total x-ray scattering as a tool to study the local atomic structure of materials exhibiting any type of structural distortions with both high real-space resolution and chemical specificity. In particular, taking advantage of the improved capabilities of 4th generation synchrotron radiation sources, such as the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National laboratory, we will implement single-photon, two-dimensional detectors to facilitate the acquisition of experimental data, enabling in-situ studies. We will also develop improved experimental data processing and modeling procedures, including user-friendly software. Results from the research will elucidate the basic physics behind fascinating phenomena in quantum materials, creating opportunities to leverage their enormous technological potential. Also, they will benefit a large community of scientists using advanced x-ray scattering techniques to study materials exhibiting structural distortions, ranging from electrolytes, glasses and nanoparticles to multiferroics, topological insulators, charge density wave systems and superconductors."

On the other hand, over the past decade or so, flash sintering (FS) emerges as a relatively new sintering technique that can achieve rapid densification of ceramic materials, especially oxides (e.g., yttria-stabilized zirconia or YSZ), within ~1-2 minutes or even a few seconds. The research objective of this proposal is toinvestigate the fundamental mechanism for flash sintering of highly conductive HTC materials and reveal the interrelationships between those materials\u2019 microstructure, defect and surface characteristics, transport properties, and their behaviors in flash sintering. To achieve this objective, technical approaches combining both experiments and theoretical calculations will be adopted. In particular, the detailed flash sintering behavior for highly conductive HTC materials (e.g., ZrN and ZrB2) will be studied including revealing the influence of processing parameters such as polarity, external pressure, sample preheating, starting relative density, and sintering aids. The samples\u2019 microstructure, local composition, point defects, surface characteristics, as well as electrical properties at different stages in flash sintering including incubation at the beginning, the transient or the flash, and the subsequent steady-state will be studied using different bulk and surface characterization techniques. In situ synchrotron study will be used to investigate the changes in HTC materials in real time during flash sintering, while their fundamental transport properties will be studied using techniques such as stable isotope-labelled diffusion-couple experiments. For theoretical calculation, finite element modeling will be used for understanding the impacts of porosity/contact area and less conductive surface shell for the powder compacts at different stages of flash sintering, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be used to reveal point defects generation and evolution and establish the relationships between defects characteristics and the electrical/diffusion characteristics displayed in the flash sintering process.

A reverse modeling strategy will be used to design an optimum test matrix. This framework will enable modeling and predicting ion-irradiated mechanical properties using reduced test data, thereby accelerating the development of novel High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) materials for beam window applications. Our research project will include nanoindentation testing and material characterization of several HEAs exposed to ion irradiation. Irradiated mechanical property prediction model and property correlation metamodels will be developed considering traditional and machine learning approaches. Extrapolation will be performed using a data superposition approach to predict the HEAs\u2019 material responses under higher irradiation conditions and the results will be validated against test data. The combined optimum testing matrix and robust modeling techniques will be used to help downselect suitable HEA compositions that are most resistant to beam-induced radiation and thermal shock damage. The development and selection of novel HEAs will ensure reliable operation and improved lifetime of beam windows in next-generation accelerator target facilities, such as the 2.4 megawatts Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility, that will support advancements in high-energy physics research."

          "public_abstract": "Lattice instabilities and emergent collective phases and behavior rooted in the quantum world PI: Valeri Petkov, Department of Physics, Central Michigan University The remarkable properties of quantum materials result from strong interactions among their electronic, lattice and spin degrees of freedom and the rich variety of ordered electronic phases that emerge as a consequence, often in a close proximity to each other. If understood and controlled at atomic level, their properties could revolutionize virtually every aspect of science and technology. A fundamental feature of many quantum materials is the locally broken crystal symmetry and presence of lattice distortions due to lattice instabilities. The properties of such materials are difficult to understand because local lattice distortions are difficult to assess using traditional crystallographic techniques. This project aims to advance through fundamental research the atomic-level understanding of collective electronic phases and behavior emerging in quantum materials exhibiting local lattice distortions. Our hypothesis is that, in many quantum materials, lattice distortions are not induced by changes in the electronic structure but appear as an independent degree of freedom that bridges electronic phases the materials may exhibit. To verify the hypothesis, we will employ resonant total x-ray scattering coupled to atomic pair distribution function analysis and large-scale 3D modeling to study the interaction between lattice distortions, electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom in charge density wave and Mott insulating systems exhibiting competing superconducting, electronic and magnetic orders. Since emergent phenomena are very sensitive to external stimuli, we will study the interaction as important physical parameters such as temperature, chemical composition and/or magnetic field are varied in a controlled manner. An integral part of our effort is the further development of resonant total x-ray scattering as a tool to study the local atomic structure of materials exhibiting any type of structural distortions with both high real-space resolution and chemical specificity. In particular, taking advantage of the improved capabilities of 4th generation synchrotron radiation sources, such as the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National laboratory, we will implement single-photon, two-dimensional detectors to facilitate the acquisition of experimental data, enabling in-situ studies. We will also develop improved experimental data processing and modeling procedures, including user-friendly software. Results from the research will elucidate the basic physics behind fascinating phenomena in quantum materials, creating opportunities to leverage their enormous technological potential. Also, they will benefit a large community of scientists using advanced x-ray scattering techniques to study materials exhibiting structural distortions, ranging from electrolytes, glasses and nanoparticles to multiferroics, topological insulators, charge density wave systems and superconductors."

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments.

However, the United States (US) faces significant challenges: many graduating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, enter the workforce without the necessary skills, hands-on experience, and research expertise in AI and HPC. The lack of adequately trained graduates impedes the nation\u2019s ability to drive innovation and achieve strategic objectives. To address the challenges, this project aims to build a regional AI community through collaborative research and traineeship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to provide students with comprehensive training in AI with HPC, equipping them with the technical expertise and practical experience needed to excel in these fields. This project has seven key objectives: (i) Establish a regional community for sustainable traineeship collaboration between Maryland institutions and the DOE lab, including shared infrastructure, cross-mentored research projects, and integrated educational resources; (ii) Train and prepare students for the future AI workforce by providing students with hands-on research experience with DOE Lab\u2019s AI projects, fostering practical skills, expertise in real-world applications, and the ability to collaborate effectively within team settings; (iii) Provide students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research projects, guided by experienced faculty and DOE scientists; (iv) Facilitate students\u2019 professional development through workshops, seminars, hackathons, and training sessions that equip students with the latest AI technologies, industry-standard tools, and ethical considerations; (v) Enhance course contents and design new course modules at the participating institutions to reflect the latest advancements in AI and incorporate practical experiences that align with industry needs; (vi) Recruit and support students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field and ensuring a wide range of perspectives in AI development; (vii) Establish long-term research collaborations between students, faculty, and DOE scientists to address critical AI challenges and advance scientific knowledge. This project is anticipated to mentor and support around 27 students over three years. Working in teams, students will collaborate with scientists at LBNL, contributing to studies that advance AI and HPC. The student participants will receive comprehensive financial support throughout the academic year and summer. Faculty and DOE scientists will hold regular mentoring meetings with student research teams. The curriculum at the participating institutions will be improved through collaboration with LBNL scientists, integrating state-of-the-art research and projects to better prepare students for careers in the AI workforce. This sustainable model ensures the long-term continuation of AI education excellence, aligning with the evolving needs in AI and HPC, as well as the DOE\u2019s mission. This project\u2019s broad impacts will contribute to preparing a highly skilled workforce in AI to ensure that the U.S. maintains its global leadership. This project will establish a strong bridge between DOE labs and academic institutions, fostering synergistic collaboration among the academic institutions themselves. Students will learn about DOE labs, internships, and career opportunities, developing the skills and professional connections needed to apply for these opportunities with confidence. The success of this program will enhance student retention by building students\u2019 confidence in conducting AI-related research. The regional AI community model can be replicated and adapted by other institutions and labs, contributing to the broader ecosystem of science education and research."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales. The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions. While the hybrid earthquake scenario generator will provide an essential capability for ensuring the resiliency and cost-effectiveness of future energy systems to earthquake risk, the framework that will be developed as part of this project will open transformative possibilities to regional-scale distributed infrastructure system resilience assessment and risk reduction more broadly. Since the machine learning algorithms will be agnostic to the earthquake source and wave propagation physics that lie under the hood, we envision the hybridized framework as a stepping stone to assessing resilience and risk associated with other hazards threatening energy systems, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and combinations thereof."

However, the United States (US) faces significant challenges: many graduating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, enter the workforce without the necessary skills, hands-on experience, and research expertise in AI and HPC. The lack of adequately trained graduates impedes the nation\u2019s ability to drive innovation and achieve strategic objectives. To address the challenges, this project aims to build a regional AI community through collaborative research and traineeship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to provide students with comprehensive training in AI with HPC, equipping them with the technical expertise and practical experience needed to excel in these fields. This project has seven key objectives: (i) Establish a regional community for sustainable traineeship collaboration between Maryland institutions and the DOE lab, including shared infrastructure, cross-mentored research projects, and integrated educational resources; (ii) Train and prepare students for the future AI workforce by providing students with hands-on research experience with DOE Lab\u2019s AI projects, fostering practical skills, expertise in real-world applications, and the ability to collaborate effectively within team settings; (iii) Provide students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research projects, guided by experienced faculty and DOE scientists; (iv) Facilitate students\u2019 professional development through workshops, seminars, hackathons, and training sessions that equip students with the latest AI technologies, industry-standard tools, and ethical considerations; (v) Enhance course contents and design new course modules at the participating institutions to reflect the latest advancements in AI and incorporate practical experiences that align with industry needs; (vi) Recruit and support students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field and ensuring a wide range of perspectives in AI development; (vii) Establish long-term research collaborations between students, faculty, and DOE scientists to address critical AI challenges and advance scientific knowledge. This project is anticipated to mentor and support around 27 students over three years. Working in teams, students will collaborate with scientists at LBNL, contributing to studies that advance AI and HPC. The student participants will receive comprehensive financial support throughout the academic year and summer. Faculty and DOE scientists will hold regular mentoring meetings with student research teams. The curriculum at the participating institutions will be improved through collaboration with LBNL scientists, integrating state-of-the-art research and projects to better prepare students for careers in the AI workforce. This sustainable model ensures the long-term continuation of AI education excellence, aligning with the evolving needs in AI and HPC, as well as the DOE\u2019s mission.

          "public_abstract": "Recent empirical demonstrations pointing toward quantum advantage have fueled excitement and growth in the field. However, many high-profile demonstrations suggesting quantum advantage have prompted improvements in classical algorithm design (e.g., tensor-network methods) and enlist additional classical resources (e.g., supercomputing) with surprising progress in closing quantum-advantage gaps. While quantum-inspired classical improvements are a healthy benefit of quantum-computing research, to ultimately realize quantum utility it is important to systematically identify, understand, and publicize sources of quantum advantage that are unlikely to be diminished as classical computing progresses. A demonstration of quantum utility may conjure the image of a plot indicating that a quantum computer performs better (with respect to some metric) than the best-known classical counterparts. This basic concept of quantum utility raises natural questions. Soundness: What evidence do we have that a quantum computer will continue to be the best way to solve this problem as input instances grow larger or more complex? Cost-effectiveness: Will a quantum computer be the most cost-effective way to solve the problem? Resource efficiency: Will some other resource considerations, such as energy to solution, rule out practical adoption of the quantum computing solution? While well-conceived notions of quantum utility have been suggested, none, to our knowledge, simultaneously take all of the above into account. Our goal is to identify sources of sustainable quantum utility, those that are sound, cost effective, and resource efficient. We believe that sustainable quantum utility is the best candidate for realizing the promise of quantum computing. We aim to discover examples of sustainable quantum utility through three guiding perspectives: (1) sustainable quantum utility should be backed by strong evidence or proof of asymptotic advantage \u2014 in other words, there should be some feature of quantum mechanics that continues to provide an advantage in a reasonably predictable manner as problem instances grow in size or complexity, (2) an array of resources beyond execution time should be considered to ensure that quantum advantages are indeed practical and that we are not overlooking unconventional quantum advantages, and (3) we should focus on developing quantum advantages for fundamental problems in broad domains such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning, that can be tailored to yield sustainable quantum utility for new and existing applications. While a major barrier to sustainable quantum utility is the current lack of mature, scalable, and error-resilient quantum computing hardware, sustainable quantum utility is also hampered by equally formidable fundamental algorithmic challenges. We address such algorithmic challenges by (1) developing unconventional quantum computing models, algorithms, and advantages that consider other computational resource bottlenecks, including running time, space/memory, solution accuracy, energy expenditure, and communication costs; (2) targeting basic scientific problems that are critical components in broad applications, such as simulating quantum systems and solving differential equations, linear systems, and continuous and discrete optimization problems; and (3) engaging in the full-stack-aware design of quantum algorithms that adjust computing-stack components to pave the way to unconventional demonstrations of sustainable quantum utility."

          "public_abstract": "Mineral scaling in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) represents a significant challenge, where solid deposits from geothermal brines (e.g., the temperature- or pressure-induced precipitation of silicates, carbonates, sulfates, and other mineral species) critically impair the efficiency of heat extraction and energy production. These deposits obstruct fluid flow, diminish heat exchange efficiency, potential equipment failures, and necessitate frequent maintenance interventions, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs. Numerous de-scaling strategies, including chemical inhibitors, mechanical removal, thermal management, etc., have been proposed and implemented; however, each of these methods presents practical limitations, especially when applied within the harsh environment of EGS. The major obstacle for these methods is the requirement for regular system shutdowns to perform maintenance, recalibration, or cleaning, exacerbating operational disruptions and economic burdens. Therefore, there is a critical need for innovative approaches to continuously and effectively inhibit mineral scaling, ensuring the long-term viability of the equipment and the cost-effectiveness of the EGS. This research aims to develop a novel class of functionalized MXenes nanocomposite (dubbed as HydroShield-X) with superhydrophobic properties as a descaling agent in EGS systems. MXene nanosheets, known for their stability under extreme conditions, will be transformed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic using optimal surface functionalizations identified through atomistic-level simulations. These coatings will be tested in laboratory setups mimicking geothermal conditions, including high temperatures (~350\u00b0C) and pressures (~20 MPa), to validate their antiscaling performance and durability. Initial lab-scale development in Phase I will be followed by commercial-scale production in Phase II and field testing potentially at the DOE-funded Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) site at Utah. HydroShield-X offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods, enhances the longevity of the equipment, reduces maintenance downtime, and is scalable to various operational conditions. This product is expected to provide a transformative solution for industries facing scaling issues, such as geothermal, oil and gas, and other geo-energy sectors, e.g., underground hydrogen storage. Additionally, in Phase I, as part of the PIER plan, MetaScape will hire a graduate student as a summer intern from University of Utah. The intern will be selected from minority groups and/or marginalized populations and will receive rigorous training on simulation models for complex material development and interpersonal skills.

However, the United States (US) faces significant challenges: many graduating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, enter the workforce without the necessary skills, hands-on experience, and research expertise in AI and HPC. The lack of adequately trained graduates impedes the nation\u2019s ability to drive innovation and achieve strategic objectives. To address the challenges, this project aims to build a regional AI community through collaborative research and traineeship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to provide students with comprehensive training in AI with HPC, equipping them with the technical expertise and practical experience needed to excel in these fields. This project has seven key objectives: (i) Establish a regional community for sustainable traineeship collaboration between Maryland institutions and the DOE lab, including shared infrastructure, cross-mentored research projects, and integrated educational resources; (ii) Train and prepare students for the future AI workforce by providing students with hands-on research experience with DOE Lab\u2019s AI projects, fostering practical skills, expertise in real-world applications, and the ability to collaborate effectively within team settings; (iii) Provide students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research projects, guided by experienced faculty and DOE scientists; (iv) Facilitate students\u2019 professional development through workshops, seminars, hackathons, and training sessions that equip students with the latest AI technologies, industry-standard tools, and ethical considerations; (v) Enhance course contents and design new course modules at the participating institutions to reflect the latest advancements in AI and incorporate practical experiences that align with industry needs; (vi) Recruit and support students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field and ensuring a wide range of perspectives in AI development; (vii) Establish long-term research collaborations between students, faculty, and DOE scientists to address critical AI challenges and advance scientific knowledge. This project is anticipated to mentor and support around 27 students over three years. Working in teams, students will collaborate with scientists at LBNL, contributing to studies that advance AI and HPC. The student participants will receive comprehensive financial support throughout the academic year and summer. Faculty and DOE scientists will hold regular mentoring meetings with student research teams. The curriculum at the participating institutions will be improved through collaboration with LBNL scientists, integrating state-of-the-art research and projects to better prepare students for careers in the AI workforce. This sustainable model ensures the long-term continuation of AI education excellence, aligning with the evolving needs in AI and HPC, as well as the DOE\u2019s mission.

The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC. This project will exploit the significant recent progress of quantum many-body physics to elucidate connections between two extensively studied models for quantum computation. Albeit intimately related, little is known about the correspondence between AQC and QAOA in regards to computational hardness and algorithmic design.

The project will strengthen the research and scientific opportunities at the three MSIs in collaboration with ANL and provide 12 students annually opportunities to engage in high-impact research focused on questions surrounding artificial and biohybrid photosynthesis. Through a year-round training program, weekly group meetings, and an annual week-long full group meeting at ANL, participants will be provided with ample networking opportunities, culturally responsive mentoring, and professional development. By engaging students in a collaborative research project and culturally responsive mentoring, faculty will work to improve the sociocultural environment and remove obstacles for the advancement of a diverse workforce in the photochemical sciences. This project builds on complementary techniques to understand and improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for solar fuel production. Nickel and cobalt molecular catalysts offer a promising opportunity for the development of new materials for solar fuel production as they are inexpensive, readily synthesized, and can be chemically modified to tune their properties. Computational modeling techniques will be utilized to understand the effect of structural changes on the catalysts. These results will aid in the design of improved biohybrid systems. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy will be utilized to characterize the charge-transfer events and electronic structure of the transition metal complexes and the biohybrid complexes. It is anticipated that the dual approach of an immersive inter-institutional research experience and culturally responsive mentoring as a means of effecting systemic change to support a diverse group of participants will lead to higher retention and persistence of a more diverse workforce.

These changes pose direct risks to current and future human generations, especially socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of these ecosystem changes, and what kinds of actions would improve outcomes, requires new collaborations that bring together researchers in physical and biological sciences to test hypotheses with landscape-scale experiments. Addressing these issues also compels strong and sustained investment in inclusive training for scientists representing all affected human communities. To meet these needs, this project will advance new and long-term partnerships between faculty and students at Western Colorado University and researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley and SLAC National Accelerator Labs, focusing on the meeting the two key objectives. First, we will develop collaborative research on climate-driven impacts to ecosystems and watershed system functionality, linking forests to floodplains in western Colorado. Second, we will create new educational opportunities that provide innovative training to diverse students through immersion in real-time research that can provide new knowledge essential to improved social and ecological outcomes. Over a four year timeframe, we will develop a suite of synergistic research activities linking current and planned DOE research in watershed function with Western\u2019s growing expertise in ecological and environmental sciences and engagement with land management agencies planning large-scale interventions. Together, these endeavors will allow us to test hypotheses around effects of disturbances such as fire, novel silvicultural treatments, and stream restoration, on ecosystem function under a changing climate.

Extracting uranium from uranium-bearing mining wastewater remedies the ecosystem and helps address uranium security for the nation's needs. Current uranium separation processes, which are primarily based on adsorption, have limited separation capacity, poor selectivity against competing ions such as sodium and magnesium, and high processing costs. In contrast, electrochemical intercalation chemistry, which allows high capacity and reversibility of cation separations using battery electrodes via a faradaic process, is an energy-efficient recovery technology. While electrochemical separations are energy-efficient, extraction capacity and selectivity limit the electrochemical separation of uranium ions from wastewater. To address these limitations, project objectives focus on understanding and controlling interactions between layered metal oxide battery electrodes and uranium-bearing wastewater to achieve high-capacity and selective separation of uranyl ions.

Current uranium separation processes, which are primarily based on adsorption, have limited separation capacity, poor selectivity against competing ions such as sodium and magnesium, and high processing costs. In contrast, electrochemical intercalation chemistry, which allows high capacity and reversibility of cation separations using battery electrodes via a faradaic process, is an energy-efficient recovery technology. While electrochemical separations are energy-efficient, extraction capacity and selectivity limit the electrochemical separation of uranium ions from wastewater. To address these limitations, project objectives focus on understanding and controlling interactions between layered metal oxide battery electrodes and uranium-bearing wastewater to achieve high-capacity and selective separation of uranyl ions. Specifically, a series of electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical processes that involve uranium ion intercalation, uranium oxide deposition, and mechanical deformation of metal oxide host materials are used to investigate how disordered metal oxide layered materials interact with uranium ions. Complementary methods, including wet-chemistry synthesis, electrochemical experiments, in situ strain/stress measurements, in situ synchrotron X-ray total scattering analysis, and electron microscopy are used to gain fundamental insights into molecular and material drivers in separation processes and reproducibility. The iterative Electro-Chemo-Mechanical process feedback loop enables a comprehensive understanding of high-capacity, selective, and stable uranium recovery using intercalative battery electrodes. The knowledge gained could impact how uranium is recovered, thus benefiting the broad chemical science community and advancing an eco-friendly critical material recovery approach."

The rare earth elements, which are elements residing near the bottom of the periodic table, are naturally abundant in various ore deposits across the globe, including the United States. Despite their domestic availability, these elements are most often obtained from foreign nations, a consequence of the environmental harm that is caused by their extraction. A significant contributing factor to the costliness and environmental damage of their harvest from natural ores lies within their chemical separation from one another. The rare earth elements occur in nature together, yet need to be separated in their pure elemental form to be used for various technological applications. The chemical similarities of these elements make this separation energy inefficient and environmentally harmful. This project is focusing on developing new strategies to separate the rare earth elements in more efficient and environmentally benign ways. The approach taken by this work is to design new synthetic receptors for the rare earth elements, called chelators. These chelators, which form direct chemical bonds with metal ions, are being synthesized and modified to attain distinct affinity patterns for the different rare earth elements. By tuning these selectivity patterns, we are able to use the chelators to achieve rare earth element separations. Toward this overall goal, the project is divided into several objectives. The first objective is focused on designing chelators that have a unique selectivity pattern that enables them to bind to both small and large rare earth elements with equal affinity, while exhibiting poor affinity for those of intermediate size. These chelators are being optimized so that they can be used to achieve unique separations to selectively afford rare earth elements within the middle of the series.

          "public_abstract": "Extracting uranium from uranium-bearing mining wastewater remedies the ecosystem and helps address uranium security for the nation's needs. Current uranium separation processes, which are primarily based on adsorption, have limited separation capacity, poor selectivity against competing ions such as sodium and magnesium, and high processing costs. In contrast, electrochemical intercalation chemistry, which allows high capacity and reversibility of cation separations using battery electrodes via a faradaic process, is an energy-efficient recovery technology. While electrochemical separations are energy-efficient, extraction capacity and selectivity limit the electrochemical separation of uranium ions from wastewater. To address these limitations, project objectives focus on understanding and controlling interactions between layered metal oxide battery electrodes and uranium-bearing wastewater to achieve high-capacity and selective separation of uranyl ions. Specifically, a series of electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical processes that involve uranium ion intercalation, uranium oxide deposition, and mechanical deformation of metal oxide host materials are used to investigate how disordered metal oxide layered materials interact with uranium ions. Complementary methods, including wet-chemistry synthesis, electrochemical experiments, in situ strain/stress measurements, in situ synchrotron X-ray total scattering analysis, and electron microscopy are used to gain fundamental insights into molecular and material drivers in separation processes and reproducibility. The iterative Electro-Chemo-Mechanical process feedback loop enables a comprehensive understanding of high-capacity, selective, and stable uranium recovery using intercalative battery electrodes. The knowledge gained could impact how uranium is recovered, thus benefiting the broad chemical science community and advancing an eco-friendly critical material recovery approach."

The program will use a tiered mentoring system that will utilize interactions between the faculty mentors, graduate students, and the undergraduate cohort. The training curriculum will last a year, starting in January and lasting through December, and there will be two training periods during the exploratory program. In addition to regular research during the spring and fall semesters, there will be scheduled group meetings (covering conduct of science, scientific writing and presentations, and usage of the scientific literature), career and graduate school mentoring, and presentation of research data by students at university, regional, and national meetings. During the summer, the student cohort research will continue; participants will be supported with a stipend for a six-week research period and will participate in a trip to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The goals for the program are that 75% of participants will either seek employment in nuclear chemistry or related careers or will continue their education in graduate programs."

These chelators, which form direct chemical bonds with metal ions, are being synthesized and modified to attain distinct affinity patterns for the different rare earth elements. By tuning these selectivity patterns, we are able to use the chelators to achieve rare earth element separations. Toward this overall goal, the project is divided into several objectives.

Current uranium separation processes, which are primarily based on adsorption, have limited separation capacity, poor selectivity against competing ions such as sodium and magnesium, and high processing costs. In contrast, electrochemical intercalation chemistry, which allows high capacity and reversibility of cation separations using battery electrodes via a faradaic process, is an energy-efficient recovery technology. While electrochemical separations are energy-efficient, extraction capacity and selectivity limit the electrochemical separation of uranium ions from wastewater. To address these limitations, project objectives focus on understanding and controlling interactions between layered metal oxide battery electrodes and uranium-bearing wastewater to achieve high-capacity and selective separation of uranyl ions. Specifically, a series of electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical processes that involve uranium ion intercalation, uranium oxide deposition, and mechanical deformation of metal oxide host materials are used to investigate how disordered metal oxide layered materials interact with uranium ions. Complementary methods, including wet-chemistry synthesis, electrochemical experiments, in situ strain/stress measurements, in situ synchrotron X-ray total scattering analysis, and electron microscopy are used to gain fundamental insights into molecular and material drivers in separation processes and reproducibility. The iterative Electro-Chemo-Mechanical process feedback loop enables a comprehensive understanding of high-capacity, selective, and stable uranium recovery using intercalative battery electrodes. The knowledge gained could impact how uranium is recovered, thus benefiting the broad chemical science community and advancing an eco-friendly critical material recovery approach.",

          "public_abstract": "Extracting uranium from uranium-bearing mining wastewater remedies the ecosystem and helps address uranium security for the nation's needs. Current uranium separation processes, which are primarily based on adsorption, have limited separation capacity, poor selectivity against competing ions such as sodium and magnesium, and high processing costs. In contrast, electrochemical intercalation chemistry, which allows high capacity and reversibility of cation separations using battery electrodes via a faradaic process, is an energy-efficient recovery technology. While electrochemical separations are energy-efficient, extraction capacity and selectivity limit the electrochemical separation of uranium ions from wastewater. To address these limitations, project objectives focus on understanding and controlling interactions between layered metal oxide battery electrodes and uranium-bearing wastewater to achieve high-capacity and selective separation of uranyl ions. Specifically, a series of electrochemical, chemical, and mechanical processes that involve uranium ion intercalation, uranium oxide deposition, and mechanical deformation of metal oxide host materials are used to investigate how disordered metal oxide layered materials interact with uranium ions. Complementary methods, including wet-chemistry synthesis, electrochemical experiments, in situ strain/stress measurements, in situ synchrotron X-ray total scattering analysis, and electron microscopy are used to gain fundamental insights into molecular and material drivers in separation processes and reproducibility. The iterative Electro-Chemo-Mechanical process feedback loop enables a comprehensive understanding of high-capacity, selective, and stable uranium recovery using intercalative battery electrodes. The knowledge gained could impact how uranium is recovered, thus benefiting the broad chemical science community and advancing an eco-friendly critical material recovery approach."

The program will use a tiered mentoring system that will utilize interactions between the faculty mentors, graduate students, and the undergraduate cohort. The training curriculum will last a year, starting in January and lasting through December, and there will be two training periods during the exploratory program. In addition to regular research during the spring and fall semesters, there will be scheduled group meetings (covering conduct of science, scientific writing and presentations, and usage of the scientific literature), career and graduate school mentoring, and presentation of research data by students at university, regional, and national meetings. During the summer, the student cohort research will continue; participants will be supported with a stipend for a six-week research period and will participate in a trip to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The goals for the program are that 75% of participants will either seek employment in nuclear chemistry or related careers or will continue their education in graduate programs."

The rare earth elements, which are elements residing near the bottom of the periodic table, are naturally abundant in various ore deposits across the globe, including the United States. Despite their domestic availability, these elements are most often obtained from foreign nations, a consequence of the environmental harm that is caused by their extraction. A significant contributing factor to the costliness and environmental damage of their harvest from natural ores lies within their chemical separation from one another. The rare earth elements occur in nature together, yet need to be separated in their pure elemental form to be used for various technological applications. The chemical similarities of these elements make this separation energy inefficient and environmentally harmful. This project is focusing on developing new strategies to separate the rare earth elements in more efficient and environmentally benign ways. The approach taken by this work is to design new synthetic receptors for the rare earth elements, called chelators. These chelators, which form direct chemical bonds with metal ions, are being synthesized and modified to attain distinct affinity patterns for the different rare earth elements. By tuning these selectivity patterns, we are able to use the chelators to achieve rare earth element separations. Toward this overall goal, the project is divided into several objectives. The first objective is focused on designing chelators that have a unique selectivity pattern that enables them to bind to both small and large rare earth elements with equal affinity, while exhibiting poor affinity for those of intermediate size. These chelators are being optimized so that they can be used to achieve unique separations to selectively afford rare earth elements within the middle of the series. In the second objective of this project, we are designing chelators that can alter the \u201couter-sphere\u201d of the rare earth elements. The outer-sphere represents the surrounding solvent and ions in solutions, and thus provide secondary types of interactions that are not afforded by conventional chelators. These chelators are being designed in order to fine-tune rare earth element selectivity patterns to enable novel separations.

We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

Promising sequestration candidates will be shared with Oak Ridge National Laboratory for further evaluation. The training component of the program seeks to increase workers in both nuclear chemistry and related fields, as well as prepare students for matriculation into chemistry graduate programs. The program will use a tiered mentoring system that will utilize interactions between the faculty mentors, graduate students, and the undergraduate cohort. The training curriculum will last a year, starting in January and lasting through December, and there will be two training periods during the exploratory program. In addition to regular research during the spring and fall semesters, there will be scheduled group meetings (covering conduct of science, scientific writing and presentations, and usage of the scientific literature), career and graduate school mentoring, and presentation of research data by students at university, regional, and national meetings. During the summer, the student cohort research will continue; participants will be supported with a stipend for a six-week research period and will participate in a trip to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The goals for the program are that 75% of participants will either seek employment in nuclear chemistry or related careers or will continue their education in graduate programs."

Despite their domestic availability, these elements are most often obtained from foreign nations, a consequence of the environmental harm that is caused by their extraction. A significant contributing factor to the costliness and environmental damage of their harvest from natural ores lies within their chemical separation from one another.

By tuning these selectivity patterns, we are able to use the chelators to achieve rare earth element separations. Toward this overall goal, the project is divided into several objectives. The first objective is focused on designing chelators that have a unique selectivity pattern that enables them to bind to both small and large rare earth elements with equal affinity, while exhibiting poor affinity for those of intermediate size.

The mapping of molecular concentrations and flow velocities with high spatial and temporal resolution using fluorescence microscopy will be extended from two to three spatial dimensions. Numerical solutions to the equations governing flow, diffusion, migration, advection, electrochemical conversion, and electronic conduction at the individual fiber and pore scale will be developed using a new method that permits large scale simulations at fine spatial resolution. This research program will lead to a deep fundamental understanding of electrolyte-filled porous electrodes. The scientific insights gained will enable the flow cell community to design high-performance electrodes from the bottom up, based solely on knowledge of the physical, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the electrolytes.

By systematically varying electrolyte composition and concentration, the project seeks to understand and control the solvation structures of lithium ions.

          "public_abstract": "Lattice instabilities and emergent collective phases and behavior rooted in the quantum world PI: Valeri Petkov, Department of Physics, Central Michigan University The remarkable properties of quantum materials result from strong interactions among their electronic, lattice and spin degrees of freedom and the rich variety of ordered electronic phases that emerge as a consequence, often in a close proximity to each other. If understood and controlled at atomic level, their properties could revolutionize virtually every aspect of science and technology. A fundamental feature of many quantum materials is the locally broken crystal symmetry and presence of lattice distortions due to lattice instabilities. The properties of such materials are difficult to understand because local lattice distortions are difficult to assess using traditional crystallographic techniques. This project aims to advance through fundamental research the atomic-level understanding of collective electronic phases and behavior emerging in quantum materials exhibiting local lattice distortions. Our hypothesis is that, in many quantum materials, lattice distortions are not induced by changes in the electronic structure but appear as an independent degree of freedom that bridges electronic phases the materials may exhibit. To verify the hypothesis, we will employ resonant total x-ray scattering coupled to atomic pair distribution function analysis and large-scale 3D modeling to study the interaction between lattice distortions, electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom in charge density wave and Mott insulating systems exhibiting competing superconducting, electronic and magnetic orders. Since emergent phenomena are very sensitive to external stimuli, we will study the interaction as important physical parameters such as temperature, chemical composition and/or magnetic field are varied in a controlled manner. An integral part of our effort is the further development of resonant total x-ray scattering as a tool to study the local atomic structure of materials exhibiting any type of structural distortions with both high real-space resolution and chemical specificity. In particular, taking advantage of the improved capabilities of 4th generation synchrotron radiation sources, such as the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National laboratory, we will implement single-photon, two-dimensional detectors to facilitate the acquisition of experimental data, enabling in-situ studies. We will also develop improved experimental data processing and modeling procedures, including user-friendly software. Results from the research will elucidate the basic physics behind fascinating phenomena in quantum materials, creating opportunities to leverage their enormous technological potential. Also, they will benefit a large community of scientists using advanced x-ray scattering techniques to study materials exhibiting structural distortions, ranging from electrolytes, glasses and nanoparticles to multiferroics, topological insulators, charge density wave systems and superconductors."

The training curriculum will last a year, starting in January and lasting through December, and there will be two training periods during the exploratory program. In addition to regular research during the spring and fall semesters, there will be scheduled group meetings (covering conduct of science, scientific writing and presentations, and usage of the scientific literature), career and graduate school mentoring, and presentation of research data by students at university, regional, and national meetings. During the summer, the student cohort research will continue; participants will be supported with a stipend for a six-week research period and will participate in a trip to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The goals for the program are that 75% of participants will either seek employment in nuclear chemistry or related careers or will continue their education in graduate programs."

A laboratory scale prototype flow measurement system was constructed and installed in a lab test fixture that simulated the flow of steam and water in a geothermal plant. The prototype system performed extremely well, providing real-time flow rate results with accuracy generally within 5%. This is a significant increase over the current flow measurement methods, which have errors as high as 20% and do not provide data real-time. Several prototypes will be developed at full scale and tested both in a laboratory and in actual operating geothermal wells. The field test will prove out the system under real world conditions and showcase the benefits of real-time, accurate data to plant operators. The success of this project will provide a new and unique flow meter for geothermal systems. The data from the measurement system will allow plant operators to track the heat energy from individual wells in real-time, which will provide greater insight on the evolution of geothermal reservoirs over time to maximize efficiency and production potential. Operators will be able to pinpoint the high and low production wells and achieve greater overall production capacity from each geothermal plant."

          "public_abstract": "This project focuses on liquid water, a critical material shaping geochemistry and life on our planet. The overarching goal is to understand how water adopts distinct properties when placed in contact with different surfaces. Key surfaces examined are clay minerals and related solids (e.g., mica) that play central roles in soil health and subsurface energy, including in soil resilience to erosion and drought, geologic CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste isolation, and enhanced geothermal energy. The approach followed in the project uses high-performance computing, supported by atomistic-level experimental characterization, to elucidate the nanoscale properties of water in clay interlayer nanopores and in adsorbed water films on mica and silica surfaces. In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to reveal the behavior of individual atoms in complex systems (where spectroscopic and other experimental methods probe the average behavior of large numbers of atoms or molecules) and the manner in which the collective properties of assemblages of millions of water molecules emerge from atomistic-level interactions. A first major focus of the project is on understanding the selective transport properties of water-filled nanopores. In other words, how do nanopores selectively transport water vs. salt, or cations vs. anions? A second major focus is on understanding the stability of adsorbed water films on mineral surfaces. Finally, a third focus is on advancing MD simulation capabilities by combining simulations with synchrotron X-ray reflectivity and Terahertz spectroscopy experiments. The research relies on simulations carried out at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a US Department of Energy facility located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and on Princeton University\u2019s high-performance computing clusters. The project involves collaborations with scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the University of Ruhr-Bochum. A key projected outcome is the critical re-examination of existing models and theories used to describe the properties of water in nanopores and thin films, including models of water and solute transport in nanopores and models of disjoining pressure in adsorbed water films. Beyond the Geosciences, this research aims to generate fundamental scientific knowledge relevant to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes; wettability and multiphase flow; chemical synthesis using interfacial or confined water as a green solvent; and other scientific areas. Finally, the project aims to accelerate the development of advanced nanogeochemical experimental approaches for the characterization of geologic media and processes, including Terahertz spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity experiments."

These deposits obstruct fluid flow, diminish heat exchange efficiency, potential equipment failures, and necessitate frequent maintenance interventions, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs. Numerous de-scaling strategies, including chemical inhibitors, mechanical removal, thermal management, etc., have been proposed and implemented; however, each of these methods presents practical limitations, especially when applied within the harsh environment of EGS. The major obstacle for these methods is the requirement for regular system shutdowns to perform maintenance, recalibration, or cleaning, exacerbating operational disruptions and economic burdens. Therefore, there is a critical need for innovative approaches to continuously and effectively inhibit mineral scaling, ensuring the long-term viability of the equipment and the cost-effectiveness of the EGS. This research aims to develop a novel class of functionalized MXenes nanocomposite (dubbed as HydroShield-X) with superhydrophobic properties as a descaling agent in EGS systems. MXene nanosheets, known for their stability under extreme conditions, will be transformed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic using optimal surface functionalizations identified through atomistic-level simulations. These coatings will be tested in laboratory setups mimicking geothermal conditions, including high temperatures (~350\u00b0C) and pressures (~20 MPa), to validate their antiscaling performance and durability. Initial lab-scale development in Phase I will be followed by commercial-scale production in Phase II and field testing potentially at the DOE-funded Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) site at Utah. HydroShield-X offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods, enhances the longevity of the equipment, reduces maintenance downtime, and is scalable to various operational conditions. This product is expected to provide a transformative solution for industries facing scaling issues, such as geothermal, oil and gas, and other geo-energy sectors, e.g., underground hydrogen storage.

The expansion of output from geothermal well sites will be an important part of the US and world energy future in order to maintain a growing base load while minimizing carbon emissions. To maximize the output and lifespan of a geothermal well, it is beneficial to monitor several parameters, including mass flow rate of both steam and water of the geofluid in real-time. This allows operators to detect changes in well health and to optimize output. Current methods are not sufficiently accurate, cannot be done in real- time, or are cost prohibitive to use for each well individually. This project proposes to develop a real-time flow measurement system that can provide the mass flow rate, liquid/vapor fraction, and the energy content, or enthalpy, to plant operators. A laboratory scale prototype flow measurement system was constructed and installed in a lab test fixture that simulated the flow of steam and water in a geothermal plant. The prototype system performed extremely well, providing real-time flow rate results with accuracy generally within 5%. This is a significant increase over the current flow measurement methods, which have errors as high as 20% and do not provide data real-time. Several prototypes will be developed at full scale and tested both in a laboratory and in actual operating geothermal wells. The field test will prove out the system under real world conditions and showcase the benefits of real-time, accurate data to plant operators. The success of this project will provide a new and unique flow meter for geothermal systems. The data from the measurement system will allow plant operators to track the heat energy from individual wells in real-time, which will provide greater insight on the evolution of geothermal reservoirs over time to maximize efficiency and production potential.

Insights from this study are expected to improve the understanding of coupled fault slip and hydrology as well as the overall hydraulic connectivity of upper crustal regimes. We will explore conditions that encourage slip-induced permeability enhancement and investigate implications for injection-induced seismic hazard."

          "public_abstract": "This project focuses on liquid water, a critical material shaping geochemistry and life on our planet. The overarching goal is to understand how water adopts distinct properties when placed in contact with different surfaces. Key surfaces examined are clay minerals and related solids (e.g., mica) that play central roles in soil health and subsurface energy, including in soil resilience to erosion and drought, geologic CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste isolation, and enhanced geothermal energy. The approach followed in the project uses high-performance computing, supported by atomistic-level experimental characterization, to elucidate the nanoscale properties of water in clay interlayer nanopores and in adsorbed water films on mica and silica surfaces. In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to reveal the behavior of individual atoms in complex systems (where spectroscopic and other experimental methods probe the average behavior of large numbers of atoms or molecules) and the manner in which the collective properties of assemblages of millions of water molecules emerge from atomistic-level interactions. A first major focus of the project is on understanding the selective transport properties of water-filled nanopores. In other words, how do nanopores selectively transport water vs. salt, or cations vs. anions? A second major focus is on understanding the stability of adsorbed water films on mineral surfaces. Finally, a third focus is on advancing MD simulation capabilities by combining simulations with synchrotron X-ray reflectivity and Terahertz spectroscopy experiments. The research relies on simulations carried out at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a US Department of Energy facility located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and on Princeton University\u2019s high-performance computing clusters. The project involves collaborations with scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the University of Ruhr-Bochum. A key projected outcome is the critical re-examination of existing models and theories used to describe the properties of water in nanopores and thin films, including models of water and solute transport in nanopores and models of disjoining pressure in adsorbed water films. Beyond the Geosciences, this research aims to generate fundamental scientific knowledge relevant to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes; wettability and multiphase flow; chemical synthesis using interfacial or confined water as a green solvent; and other scientific areas. Finally, the project aims to accelerate the development of advanced nanogeochemical experimental approaches for the characterization of geologic media and processes, including Terahertz spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity experiments."

A laboratory scale prototype flow measurement system was constructed and installed in a lab test fixture that simulated the flow of steam and water in a geothermal plant. The prototype system performed extremely well, providing real-time flow rate results with accuracy generally within 5%. This is a significant increase over the current flow measurement methods, which have errors as high as 20% and do not provide data real-time. Several prototypes will be developed at full scale and tested both in a laboratory and in actual operating geothermal wells. The field test will prove out the system under real world conditions and showcase the benefits of real-time, accurate data to plant operators. The success of this project will provide a new and unique flow meter for geothermal systems. The data from the measurement system will allow plant operators to track the heat energy from individual wells in real-time, which will provide greater insight on the evolution of geothermal reservoirs over time to maximize efficiency and production potential. Operators will be able to pinpoint the high and low production wells and achieve greater overall production capacity from each geothermal plant."

This is a significant increase over the current flow measurement methods, which have errors as high as 20% and do not provide data real-time. Several prototypes will be developed at full scale and tested both in a laboratory and in actual operating geothermal wells. The field test will prove out the system under real world conditions and showcase the benefits of real-time, accurate data to plant operators. The success of this project will provide a new and unique flow meter for geothermal systems.

          "chunk_text": "Mineral scaling in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) represents a significant challenge, where solid deposits from geothermal brines (e.g., the temperature- or pressure-induced precipitation of silicates, carbonates, sulfates, and other mineral species) critically impair the efficiency of heat extraction and energy production. These deposits obstruct fluid flow, diminish heat exchange efficiency, potential equipment failures, and necessitate frequent maintenance interventions, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs. Numerous de-scaling strategies, including chemical inhibitors, mechanical removal, thermal management, etc., have been proposed and implemented; however, each of these methods presents practical limitations, especially when applied within the harsh environment of EGS. The major obstacle for these methods is the requirement for regular system shutdowns to perform maintenance, recalibration, or cleaning, exacerbating operational disruptions and economic burdens. Therefore, there is a critical need for innovative approaches to continuously and effectively inhibit mineral scaling, ensuring the long-term viability of the equipment and the cost-effectiveness of the EGS. This research aims to develop a novel class of functionalized MXenes nanocomposite (dubbed as HydroShield-X) with superhydrophobic properties as a descaling agent in EGS systems.

These deposits obstruct fluid flow, diminish heat exchange efficiency, potential equipment failures, and necessitate frequent maintenance interventions, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs. Numerous de-scaling strategies, including chemical inhibitors, mechanical removal, thermal management, etc., have been proposed and implemented; however, each of these methods presents practical limitations, especially when applied within the harsh environment of EGS. The major obstacle for these methods is the requirement for regular system shutdowns to perform maintenance, recalibration, or cleaning, exacerbating operational disruptions and economic burdens.

          "public_abstract": "This project focuses on liquid water, a critical material shaping geochemistry and life on our planet. The overarching goal is to understand how water adopts distinct properties when placed in contact with different surfaces. Key surfaces examined are clay minerals and related solids (e.g., mica) that play central roles in soil health and subsurface energy, including in soil resilience to erosion and drought, geologic CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste isolation, and enhanced geothermal energy. The approach followed in the project uses high-performance computing, supported by atomistic-level experimental characterization, to elucidate the nanoscale properties of water in clay interlayer nanopores and in adsorbed water films on mica and silica surfaces. In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to reveal the behavior of individual atoms in complex systems (where spectroscopic and other experimental methods probe the average behavior of large numbers of atoms or molecules) and the manner in which the collective properties of assemblages of millions of water molecules emerge from atomistic-level interactions. A first major focus of the project is on understanding the selective transport properties of water-filled nanopores. In other words, how do nanopores selectively transport water vs. salt, or cations vs. anions? A second major focus is on understanding the stability of adsorbed water films on mineral surfaces. Finally, a third focus is on advancing MD simulation capabilities by combining simulations with synchrotron X-ray reflectivity and Terahertz spectroscopy experiments. The research relies on simulations carried out at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a US Department of Energy facility located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and on Princeton University\u2019s high-performance computing clusters. The project involves collaborations with scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the University of Ruhr-Bochum. A key projected outcome is the critical re-examination of existing models and theories used to describe the properties of water in nanopores and thin films, including models of water and solute transport in nanopores and models of disjoining pressure in adsorbed water films. Beyond the Geosciences, this research aims to generate fundamental scientific knowledge relevant to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes; wettability and multiphase flow; chemical synthesis using interfacial or confined water as a green solvent; and other scientific areas. Finally, the project aims to accelerate the development of advanced nanogeochemical experimental approaches for the characterization of geologic media and processes, including Terahertz spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity experiments."

Numerous de-scaling strategies, including chemical inhibitors, mechanical removal, thermal management, etc., have been proposed and implemented; however, each of these methods presents practical limitations, especially when applied within the harsh environment of EGS.

Therefore, there is a critical need for innovative approaches to continuously and effectively inhibit mineral scaling, ensuring the long-term viability of the equipment and the cost-effectiveness of the EGS. This research aims to develop a novel class of functionalized MXenes nanocomposite (dubbed as HydroShield-X) with superhydrophobic properties as a descaling agent in EGS systems. MXene nanosheets, known for their stability under extreme conditions, will be transformed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic using optimal surface functionalizations identified through atomistic-level simulations. These coatings will be tested in laboratory setups mimicking geothermal conditions, including high temperatures (~350\u00b0C) and pressures (~20 MPa), to validate their antiscaling performance and durability.

          "public_abstract": "Mineral scaling in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) represents a significant challenge, where solid deposits from geothermal brines (e.g., the temperature- or pressure-induced precipitation of silicates, carbonates, sulfates, and other mineral species) critically impair the efficiency of heat extraction and energy production. These deposits obstruct fluid flow, diminish heat exchange efficiency, potential equipment failures, and necessitate frequent maintenance interventions, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased costs. Numerous de-scaling strategies, including chemical inhibitors, mechanical removal, thermal management, etc., have been proposed and implemented; however, each of these methods presents practical limitations, especially when applied within the harsh environment of EGS. The major obstacle for these methods is the requirement for regular system shutdowns to perform maintenance, recalibration, or cleaning, exacerbating operational disruptions and economic burdens. Therefore, there is a critical need for innovative approaches to continuously and effectively inhibit mineral scaling, ensuring the long-term viability of the equipment and the cost-effectiveness of the EGS. This research aims to develop a novel class of functionalized MXenes nanocomposite (dubbed as HydroShield-X) with superhydrophobic properties as a descaling agent in EGS systems. MXene nanosheets, known for their stability under extreme conditions, will be transformed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic using optimal surface functionalizations identified through atomistic-level simulations. These coatings will be tested in laboratory setups mimicking geothermal conditions, including high temperatures (~350\u00b0C) and pressures (~20 MPa), to validate their antiscaling performance and durability. Initial lab-scale development in Phase I will be followed by commercial-scale production in Phase II and field testing potentially at the DOE-funded Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) site at Utah. HydroShield-X offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods, enhances the longevity of the equipment, reduces maintenance downtime, and is scalable to various operational conditions.

          "public_abstract": "This project focuses on liquid water, a critical material shaping geochemistry and life on our planet. The overarching goal is to understand how water adopts distinct properties when placed in contact with different surfaces. Key surfaces examined are clay minerals and related solids (e.g., mica) that play central roles in soil health and subsurface energy, including in soil resilience to erosion and drought, geologic CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste isolation, and enhanced geothermal energy. The approach followed in the project uses high-performance computing, supported by atomistic-level experimental characterization, to elucidate the nanoscale properties of water in clay interlayer nanopores and in adsorbed water films on mica and silica surfaces. In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to reveal the behavior of individual atoms in complex systems (where spectroscopic and other experimental methods probe the average behavior of large numbers of atoms or molecules) and the manner in which the collective properties of assemblages of millions of water molecules emerge from atomistic-level interactions. A first major focus of the project is on understanding the selective transport properties of water-filled nanopores. In other words, how do nanopores selectively transport water vs. salt, or cations vs. anions? A second major focus is on understanding the stability of adsorbed water films on mineral surfaces. Finally, a third focus is on advancing MD simulation capabilities by combining simulations with synchrotron X-ray reflectivity and Terahertz spectroscopy experiments. The research relies on simulations carried out at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a US Department of Energy facility located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and on Princeton University\u2019s high-performance computing clusters. The project involves collaborations with scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the University of Ruhr-Bochum. A key projected outcome is the critical re-examination of existing models and theories used to describe the properties of water in nanopores and thin films, including models of water and solute transport in nanopores and models of disjoining pressure in adsorbed water films. Beyond the Geosciences, this research aims to generate fundamental scientific knowledge relevant to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes; wettability and multiphase flow; chemical synthesis using interfacial or confined water as a green solvent; and other scientific areas. Finally, the project aims to accelerate the development of advanced nanogeochemical experimental approaches for the characterization of geologic media and processes, including Terahertz spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity experiments."

Proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis is the favored pathway currently for green hydrogen but has significant fundamental scientific challenges in terms of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst used due to the complexity of materials and reactions involved. Our limited understanding of catalyst degradation, which involves surface reconstruction and metal dissolution under the highly oxidizing potentials and corrosive environments encountered during oxygen evolution under acidic conditions, remains a bottleneck to the development of improved catalysts. The project objectives are to develop new research capabilities at Texas State University, in partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and to understand how surface reconstruction affects metal dissolution rates and degradation mechanisms in metal oxide OER electrocatalysts. The research scope involves the evaluation of how metal substituents, crystal structure, and defects affect surface reconstruction and degradation. Through this collaborative effort, the project will help advance understanding of surface structure-activity-degradation relationships and inform the development of highly active, durable OER electrocatalysts for lower cost, highly durable PEM electrolyzers while expanding knowledge and infrastructure that can applied to numerous electrocatalytic reactions. The project will also expand research capabilities at Texas State University, one of the largest Hispanic Serving Institutions in the U.S., with a large population of students from underrepresented groups and first-generation college students.

Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions.

This instability in the supply chain can also cause problems for national security. Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE.

Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications.

This is an important step in moving toward materials sustainability and will be critical in situations where suitable alternatives to PGE are prohibitively difficult to identify. By epitaxially depositing a monolayer or thin multilayer of a PGE onto shaped non-PGE nanoparticles, the required arrangement of PGE atoms for a particular catalytic transformation can be achieved and stabilized while reducing the amount of the PGE required by orders of magnitude."

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions. Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures.

The photocatalytic activity is known to be highly heterogeneous both in an ensemble of nanomaterials and within a single particle. Despite significant research activity, the understanding of photocatalytic heterogeneity remains incomplete. We propose to use nanoelectrochemical techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to carry out quantitative, spatially resolved photoelectrochemical experiments aimed at measuring photo(electro)catalytic activity and characterizing heterogeneity of a wide range of semiconductor nanomaterials. We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials.

          "public_abstract": "Semiconductor nanomaterials, including 2D nanosheets and microscopic single crystals have important technological applications ranging from fuel production to electrosynthesis. The photocatalytic activity is known to be highly heterogeneous both in an ensemble of nanomaterials and within a single particle. Despite significant research activity, the understanding of photocatalytic heterogeneity remains incomplete. We propose to use nanoelectrochemical techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to carry out quantitative, spatially resolved photoelectrochemical experiments aimed at measuring photo(electro)catalytic activity and characterizing heterogeneity of a wide range of semiconductor nanomaterials. We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

Personick, University of Virginia (Principal Investigator) Platinum group elements (PGE) such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are key components in many energy storage technologies, including fuel cells and the sustainable production of liquid fuels using renewable electricity. However, the relative scarcity of these elements creates problems for scale up and implementation of sustainable energy technologies due to the high prices of these elements and uncertainty in their sourcing. This instability in the supply chain can also cause problems for national security. Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE. This proposal addresses a significant fundamental knowledge gap in the synthesis of non-PGE nanoparticles with well-defined shapes. Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications. The integrated electrochemical approach to be employed in this work introduces unique flexibility in synthetic design that will enable both enhanced fundamental insight into non-PGE metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms and the development of innovative synthesis approaches that move beyond the classic conditions employed in the field. Using real-time electrochemical measurements, our integrated approach allows us to define desired parameters for the selection of novel reaction conditions for nanoparticle synthesis, thus breaking the boundaries of literature precedent. In addition, we will probe the mechanistic roles of components such as surfactants and shape-directing agents in ways that are not possible using colloidal synthesis development approaches, providing a more complete understanding of the critically important role of these additives in colloidal growth. Finally, our electrochemical synthesis makes it possible to precisely tune the reaction conditions at each step of nanoparticle growth while also providing real-time insight into the impact of changing reaction conditions.

This is an important step in moving toward materials sustainability and will be critical in situations where suitable alternatives to PGE are prohibitively difficult to identify. By epitaxially depositing a monolayer or thin multilayer of a PGE onto shaped non-PGE nanoparticles, the required arrangement of PGE atoms for a particular catalytic transformation can be achieved and stabilized while reducing the amount of the PGE required by orders of magnitude."

Aim 2 will build from prior work within the group that demonstrated electronic and mechanistic parallels between a modified nickel-substituted azurin model and ACS. New variants will be pursued to develop functional models of ACS, allowing resolution of the key protein-derived factors influencing reactivity. Specific contributors to substrate channeling will be investigated in Aim 3. The development of functional, robust enzymes that catalyze CO2 reduction and carbon-carbon bond formation will provide catalyst design guidelines for sustainable generation of liquid fuels from CO2, addressing one of the fundamental priority research opportunities for solar fuels identified by the DOE."

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions.

We propose to use nanoelectrochemical techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to carry out quantitative, spatially resolved photoelectrochemical experiments aimed at measuring photo(electro)catalytic activity and characterizing heterogeneity of a wide range of semiconductor nanomaterials. We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions. Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures. We plan to use selective poisons and site blockers to help identify and quantify active sites and design doping (P, B, O, halogen) strategies to enhance the CNx activity/selectivity by changing the electronic structure around the active sites.

In a research environment where diversity is valued, equity is ingrained, and inclusion is integral, the center of Atomic Level Compositional Complexity for Electrocatalysis, Atomic -C2E, will integrate fundamental electrochemistry, ab initio quantum chemical and multi-scale simulations, and materials chemistry to develop a mechanistic understanding of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and the limiting step/s during water electrolysis in O2 evolution reaction (OER). Acquiring this knowledge will directly support the goals of the Hydrogen and Carbon Negative DOE Energy Earthshots. The elucidated fundamental insights will address technological bottlenecks challenging current electrocatalysts, such as high cost, poor stability, limited efficiency and/or selectivity of value-added products. Three interconnected thrusts will be pursued with a focus on achieving an atomic-level understanding. The thrusts\u2019 aims are to 1) Elucidate the effects of high compositional heterogeneity in electrocatalytically active surfaces, specifically high entropy oxides for OER in acidic environments. This thrust will investigate how strong compositional heterogeneity can be used to promote robust electrocatalytically active surfaces; 2) Correlate the compositional and structural rigor and tunability with CO2RR electrocatalytic activity and selectivity, i.e., the relative kinetics and proximity effects in atomically precise nanoclusters. Copper and gold will be the primary metals of interest to boost the production efficiency and selectivity of value-added products; 3) Develop and apply transferable multiscale computational models with experimental feedback, and to aid and guide experiments transcending specific material types. Atomic-C2E is led by Georgia State University (GSU), a Predominantly Black and Hispanic Serving Institution in downtown Atlanta. GSU is within about 2.5-hour drive to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), enabling effective and efficient outreach to underrepresented workforces and hands-on access to state-of-the-art facilities as elaborated in our Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER) Plan. This research was selected for funding by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences. _____________________________________________________________________________________"

          "public_abstract": "An Integrated Electrochemical Approach to the Precision Synthesis of Sustainable Catalyst Materials Michelle L. Personick, University of Virginia (Principal Investigator) Platinum group elements (PGE) such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are key components in many energy storage technologies, including fuel cells and the sustainable production of liquid fuels using renewable electricity. However, the relative scarcity of these elements creates problems for scale up and implementation of sustainable energy technologies due to the high prices of these elements and uncertainty in their sourcing. This instability in the supply chain can also cause problems for national security. Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE. This proposal addresses a significant fundamental knowledge gap in the synthesis of non-PGE nanoparticles with well-defined shapes. Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications. The integrated electrochemical approach to be employed in this work introduces unique flexibility in synthetic design that will enable both enhanced fundamental insight into non-PGE metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms and the development of innovative synthesis approaches that move beyond the classic conditions employed in the field. Using real-time electrochemical measurements, our integrated approach allows us to define desired parameters for the selection of novel reaction conditions for nanoparticle synthesis, thus breaking the boundaries of literature precedent. In addition, we will probe the mechanistic roles of components such as surfactants and shape-directing agents in ways that are not possible using colloidal synthesis development approaches, providing a more complete understanding of the critically important role of these additives in colloidal growth. Finally, our electrochemical synthesis makes it possible to precisely tune the reaction conditions at each step of nanoparticle growth while also providing real-time insight into the impact of changing reaction conditions. It is thus a powerful tool for the precision design and implementation of nanoparticle syntheses that control the dynamics of reaction chemistry in a way that is well outside the limits of what is possible with existing methods. Coupled with these efforts, the successful development of methods for synthesizing nanoparticles of non-PGE with tailored surface facets\u2014including high-energy stepped surfaces\u2014will also provide a platform for a reduction in the use of PGE and noble metals without necessarily needing to replace them completely. This is an important step in moving toward materials sustainability and will be critical in situations where suitable alternatives to PGE are prohibitively difficult to identify. By epitaxially depositing a monolayer or thin multilayer of a PGE onto shaped non-PGE nanoparticles, the required arrangement of PGE atoms for a particular catalytic transformation can be achieved and stabilized while reducing the amount of the PGE required by orders of magnitude."

We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions.

Our work has the potential to impact quantum approaches to solving scientific problems of interest to DOE. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to inform the design and training of variational algorithms more generally, thus, extending the applicability to the variational quantum eigensolver and electronic structure calculations. In addition, our work could assist in circumventing barren plateaus, where optimal AQC schedules are used to provide near-optimal initial conditions when training large variational algorithms. More broadly, our work can supply intuition into the potential utility of a particular quantum computing model based on the specifications of the computational problem. As a result, the need for extensive empirical benchmarking utilizing costly classical and quantum computational resources could be reduced."

          "public_abstract": "Recent empirical demonstrations pointing toward quantum advantage have fueled excitement and growth in the field. However, many high-profile demonstrations suggesting quantum advantage have prompted improvements in classical algorithm design (e.g., tensor-network methods) and enlist additional classical resources (e.g., supercomputing) with surprising progress in closing quantum-advantage gaps. While quantum-inspired classical improvements are a healthy benefit of quantum-computing research, to ultimately realize quantum utility it is important to systematically identify, understand, and publicize sources of quantum advantage that are unlikely to be diminished as classical computing progresses. A demonstration of quantum utility may conjure the image of a plot indicating that a quantum computer performs better (with respect to some metric) than the best-known classical counterparts. This basic concept of quantum utility raises natural questions. Soundness: What evidence do we have that a quantum computer will continue to be the best way to solve this problem as input instances grow larger or more complex? Cost-effectiveness: Will a quantum computer be the most cost-effective way to solve the problem? Resource efficiency: Will some other resource considerations, such as energy to solution, rule out practical adoption of the quantum computing solution? While well-conceived notions of quantum utility have been suggested, none, to our knowledge, simultaneously take all of the above into account. Our goal is to identify sources of sustainable quantum utility, those that are sound, cost effective, and resource efficient. We believe that sustainable quantum utility is the best candidate for realizing the promise of quantum computing. We aim to discover examples of sustainable quantum utility through three guiding perspectives: (1) sustainable quantum utility should be backed by strong evidence or proof of asymptotic advantage \u2014 in other words, there should be some feature of quantum mechanics that continues to provide an advantage in a reasonably predictable manner as problem instances grow in size or complexity, (2) an array of resources beyond execution time should be considered to ensure that quantum advantages are indeed practical and that we are not overlooking unconventional quantum advantages, and (3) we should focus on developing quantum advantages for fundamental problems in broad domains such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning, that can be tailored to yield sustainable quantum utility for new and existing applications. While a major barrier to sustainable quantum utility is the current lack of mature, scalable, and error-resilient quantum computing hardware, sustainable quantum utility is also hampered by equally formidable fundamental algorithmic challenges. We address such algorithmic challenges by (1) developing unconventional quantum computing models, algorithms, and advantages that consider other computational resource bottlenecks, including running time, space/memory, solution accuracy, energy expenditure, and communication costs; (2) targeting basic scientific problems that are critical components in broad applications, such as simulating quantum systems and solving differential equations, linear systems, and continuous and discrete optimization problems; and (3) engaging in the full-stack-aware design of quantum algorithms that adjust computing-stack components to pave the way to unconventional demonstrations of sustainable quantum utility."

To help realize this future potential, researchers at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams and Michigan State University are investigating applications of quantum computing to the nuclear many-body problem and the development of more efficient quantum algorithms. In this proposal, we explore new connections between nuclear theory and quantum computing. The investigators will design novel quantum algorithms and error reduction techniques using the principles of effective field theory and the renormalization group. Effective field theory refers to the study of interacting quantum systems using effective interactions that become dominant in the low-energy limit. The renormalization group refers to the evolution of effective interactions as the resolution scale is changed. Effective field theory and its implementation using renormalization group methods have been central to recent progress in nuclear theory using classical computation. We propose to apply these tools to design quantum algorithms with accelerated performance and reduced errors on quantum devices. Trotter step errors arise from the nonzero time step associated with the discretized time evolution of quantum systems. We address the reduction of Trotter step errors using extrapolation and the renormalization of interaction coefficients. We also study the construction of initial states with improved overlap with energy eigenstates to be used with quantum state preparation methods such as the rodeo algorithm."

The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC. This project will exploit the significant recent progress of quantum many-body physics to elucidate connections between two extensively studied models for quantum computation. Albeit intimately related, little is known about the correspondence between AQC and QAOA in regards to computational hardness and algorithmic design. Our study will provide important, broadly relevant details about these properties by (1) using entanglement growth as a proxy for problem hardness and (2) focusing on a computational problem class of practical relevance. Our work has the potential to impact quantum approaches to solving scientific problems of interest to DOE. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to inform the design and training of variational algorithms more generally, thus, extending the applicability to the variational quantum eigensolver and electronic structure calculations. In addition, our work could assist in circumventing barren plateaus, where optimal AQC schedules are used to provide near-optimal initial conditions when training large variational algorithms. More broadly, our work can supply intuition into the potential utility of a particular quantum computing model based on the specifications of the computational problem. As a result, the need for extensive empirical benchmarking utilizing costly classical and quantum computational resources could be reduced."

Cheng, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Co-Investigator) The proposed research will develop and deploy Quantum Digital Twins (QDT), hardware emulators that are individual digital clones of existing quantum devises. The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework. A key feature of our QDTs is the bi-directional interaction between virtual and physical siblings. In a calibration phase, a QDT\u2019s performance is monitored and improved in a cost-efficient way by optimal experimental design. When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products. Our research has the potential to influence quantum computing methods for addressing scientific challenges relevant to the DOE.

Cheng, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Co-Investigator) The proposed research will develop and deploy Quantum Digital Twins (QDT), hardware emulators that are individual digital clones of existing quantum devises. The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework. A key feature of our QDTs is the bi-directional interaction between virtual and physical siblings. In a calibration phase, a QDT\u2019s performance is monitored and improved in a cost-efficient way by optimal experimental design. When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products.

          "public_abstract": "Recent empirical demonstrations pointing toward quantum advantage have fueled excitement and growth in the field. However, many high-profile demonstrations suggesting quantum advantage have prompted improvements in classical algorithm design (e.g., tensor-network methods) and enlist additional classical resources (e.g., supercomputing) with surprising progress in closing quantum-advantage gaps. While quantum-inspired classical improvements are a healthy benefit of quantum-computing research, to ultimately realize quantum utility it is important to systematically identify, understand, and publicize sources of quantum advantage that are unlikely to be diminished as classical computing progresses. A demonstration of quantum utility may conjure the image of a plot indicating that a quantum computer performs better (with respect to some metric) than the best-known classical counterparts. This basic concept of quantum utility raises natural questions. Soundness: What evidence do we have that a quantum computer will continue to be the best way to solve this problem as input instances grow larger or more complex? Cost-effectiveness: Will a quantum computer be the most cost-effective way to solve the problem? Resource efficiency: Will some other resource considerations, such as energy to solution, rule out practical adoption of the quantum computing solution? While well-conceived notions of quantum utility have been suggested, none, to our knowledge, simultaneously take all of the above into account. Our goal is to identify sources of sustainable quantum utility, those that are sound, cost effective, and resource efficient. We believe that sustainable quantum utility is the best candidate for realizing the promise of quantum computing. We aim to discover examples of sustainable quantum utility through three guiding perspectives: (1) sustainable quantum utility should be backed by strong evidence or proof of asymptotic advantage \u2014 in other words, there should be some feature of quantum mechanics that continues to provide an advantage in a reasonably predictable manner as problem instances grow in size or complexity, (2) an array of resources beyond execution time should be considered to ensure that quantum advantages are indeed practical and that we are not overlooking unconventional quantum advantages, and (3) we should focus on developing quantum advantages for fundamental problems in broad domains such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning, that can be tailored to yield sustainable quantum utility for new and existing applications. While a major barrier to sustainable quantum utility is the current lack of mature, scalable, and error-resilient quantum computing hardware, sustainable quantum utility is also hampered by equally formidable fundamental algorithmic challenges. We address such algorithmic challenges by (1) developing unconventional quantum computing models, algorithms, and advantages that consider other computational resource bottlenecks, including running time, space/memory, solution accuracy, energy expenditure, and communication costs; (2) targeting basic scientific problems that are critical components in broad applications, such as simulating quantum systems and solving differential equations, linear systems, and continuous and discrete optimization problems; and (3) engaging in the full-stack-aware design of quantum algorithms that adjust computing-stack components to pave the way to unconventional demonstrations of sustainable quantum utility."

The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC. This project will exploit the significant recent progress of quantum many-body physics to elucidate connections between two extensively studied models for quantum computation.

In high energy physics, there are many important problems which are likely to only be solvable with sufficiently advanced quantum simulations. Chief among these are problems related to understanding the dynamical properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the strong nuclear force responsible for the structure of nuclei. To use quantum computers effectively as a tool for studying QCD will require significant research investment into different methods for modeling QCD on quantum hardware; developing classical computing tools to support the quantum simulation; and devising efficient quantum algorithms to make the most of finite resources. This grant will support research along each of these axes, building the knowledge base and infrastructure to enable groundbreaking applications of quantum simulations to high energy physics as quantum technology evolves."

Cheng, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Co-Investigator) The proposed research will develop and deploy Quantum Digital Twins (QDT), hardware emulators that are individual digital clones of existing quantum devises. The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework. A key feature of our QDTs is the bi-directional interaction between virtual and physical siblings. In a calibration phase, a QDT\u2019s performance is monitored and improved in a cost-efficient way by optimal experimental design. When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products.

The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC. This project will exploit the significant recent progress of quantum many-body physics to elucidate connections between two extensively studied models for quantum computation.

Cheng, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Co-Investigator) The proposed research will develop and deploy Quantum Digital Twins (QDT), hardware emulators that are individual digital clones of existing quantum devises. The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework. A key feature of our QDTs is the bi-directional interaction between virtual and physical siblings. In a calibration phase, a QDT\u2019s performance is monitored and improved in a cost-efficient way by optimal experimental design. When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products. Our research has the potential to influence quantum computing methods for addressing scientific challenges relevant to the DOE.

          "public_abstract": "Recent empirical demonstrations pointing toward quantum advantage have fueled excitement and growth in the field. However, many high-profile demonstrations suggesting quantum advantage have prompted improvements in classical algorithm design (e.g., tensor-network methods) and enlist additional classical resources (e.g., supercomputing) with surprising progress in closing quantum-advantage gaps. While quantum-inspired classical improvements are a healthy benefit of quantum-computing research, to ultimately realize quantum utility it is important to systematically identify, understand, and publicize sources of quantum advantage that are unlikely to be diminished as classical computing progresses. A demonstration of quantum utility may conjure the image of a plot indicating that a quantum computer performs better (with respect to some metric) than the best-known classical counterparts. This basic concept of quantum utility raises natural questions. Soundness: What evidence do we have that a quantum computer will continue to be the best way to solve this problem as input instances grow larger or more complex? Cost-effectiveness: Will a quantum computer be the most cost-effective way to solve the problem? Resource efficiency: Will some other resource considerations, such as energy to solution, rule out practical adoption of the quantum computing solution? While well-conceived notions of quantum utility have been suggested, none, to our knowledge, simultaneously take all of the above into account. Our goal is to identify sources of sustainable quantum utility, those that are sound, cost effective, and resource efficient. We believe that sustainable quantum utility is the best candidate for realizing the promise of quantum computing. We aim to discover examples of sustainable quantum utility through three guiding perspectives: (1) sustainable quantum utility should be backed by strong evidence or proof of asymptotic advantage \u2014 in other words, there should be some feature of quantum mechanics that continues to provide an advantage in a reasonably predictable manner as problem instances grow in size or complexity, (2) an array of resources beyond execution time should be considered to ensure that quantum advantages are indeed practical and that we are not overlooking unconventional quantum advantages, and (3) we should focus on developing quantum advantages for fundamental problems in broad domains such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning, that can be tailored to yield sustainable quantum utility for new and existing applications. While a major barrier to sustainable quantum utility is the current lack of mature, scalable, and error-resilient quantum computing hardware, sustainable quantum utility is also hampered by equally formidable fundamental algorithmic challenges. We address such algorithmic challenges by (1) developing unconventional quantum computing models, algorithms, and advantages that consider other computational resource bottlenecks, including running time, space/memory, solution accuracy, energy expenditure, and communication costs; (2) targeting basic scientific problems that are critical components in broad applications, such as simulating quantum systems and solving differential equations, linear systems, and continuous and discrete optimization problems; and (3) engaging in the full-stack-aware design of quantum algorithms that adjust computing-stack components to pave the way to unconventional demonstrations of sustainable quantum utility."

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments. The goal of the proposed research effort is the realization of new strategies for resisting hydrogen embrittlement at extreme temperatures.

The potential impact of the work is in the hypothesis that SDs in HOTIs can host 1D quantum matter, given that HOTIs exhibit topologically protected states at hinges or corners and screw dislocations act naturally as an \u201cinternal\u201d boundary of a crystal. Theoretical calculations confirm this hypothesis by showing helical topological states in screw dislocations. These topological line states reside deep in the bandgap of HOTIs, leading to enhanced quantum coherence, which is critical to realizing fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this work, SDs are synthesized by stacking two single-crystalline nanomembranes (NMs) with controlled twist angles, followed by heat treatment. Tuning the thickness of the membrane, boundary conditions, and twist angle between the two NMs will systematically and deterministically change the periodicity, width, and orientation of the dislocations. The focus will be on Bi and Bi compounds (e.g., BiSb and BiTe) as they have previously been shown to host high-order topological states theoretically and experimentally. The research will integrate synthesis and structural characterization (both in-situ and ex-situ) of SDs in HOTI NMs. NMs provide access to a wide array of boundary conditions, including free vs. fixed and planar vs. non-planar surface boundaries. In addition, by varying the thickness of the NM, one can tailor the distance between the nucleation site of a SD (i.e., an interfacial twist boundary) and a surface boundary with arbitrary characteristics. Numerous theoretical models suggest that changes in the elastic energy and crystalline structure at surface boundaries may play a significant role in determining the kinetics of SDs\u2019 growth from interfacial twist boundaries as well as the structure of individual SDs and their networks. Despite a wealth of theoretical reports on the boundary-controlled behavior of dislocations, a comprehensive experimental study of this important aspect has not been carried out. Thus, there is no deterministic control and fundamental understanding of boundary-controlled nucleation, growth, and mobility of SDs in any ultra-thin material, including HOTIs.

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments. The goal of the proposed research effort is the realization of new strategies for resisting hydrogen embrittlement at extreme temperatures.

The gas detection generated by SPR will be compared with GC-MS to establish an experimental relationship between simultaneous temperature and gas detection in SPR imaging. Ultra-fast measurements and computer simulations, incorporating advanced physics and chemistry models, will be employed to observe how rapidly these materials generate gas. The measurements will monitor the process from extremely brief moments to longer durations. This will enhance our understanding of heat transfer through the material, which is essential for improving process efficiency. The research outcome will be significant as it allows simultaneous measurement of temperature and gas generation from nanoparticles, providing a direct relationship between thermal energy and hydrogen generation. It will clarify the primary mechanism in enhanced hydrogen generation. This technique has applications in various fields, including clean energy, medicine, and chemical processes. The project aligns well with DOE Basic Energy Science priorities and will leverage the existing capabilities at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC) and the state-of-the-art facilities at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), preparing the project team thoroughly for this research. This collaboration holds great potential for new discoveries in how light interacts with materials to produce chemical reactions like hydrogen production. The project will foster a constructive partnership between TAMU-CC and SNL, aiding TAMU-CC, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) in the Coastal Bend region of South Texas, in expanding its research capabilities in fundamental science. Students, a post-graduate researcher, and the lead scientist will benefit from access to cutting-edge equipment and the opportunity to exchange ideas with experts in the field."

Based on the results, we will select adequate reactive element (RE) materials as a protective coating over R-SOFC\u2019s metallic components (e.g., interconnects and substrates) using our innovative, low-cost, geometry-independent \u201chot dipping\u201d coating process in Phase-II project. We highly anticipate that the new RE coatings selected based on the Phase I results can protect the FSS-based metallic components in R-SOFCs from being aggressively oxidized under harsh steam electrolysis conditions by preferentially forming a dense, continuous and thin protective scale. During Phase I, Save Mother Earth, LLC, along with University of South Carolina, will carry out specially designed corrosion experiments, comprehensive surface/bulk chemical and microstructural analysis, Cr-transport kinetic studies and thermodynamic assessments. The outcomes of this Phase-I research will lay a solid foundation for Phase II work aiming to implement RE coatings technology into R-SOFC stacks. We anticipate that the new RE coatings will reduce the corrosion rate of metallic components by 200% and enable >500 hours operation with acceptable degradation rate under simulated steam electrolysis conditions (>90% steam) specified in topic C59-09 Corrosion Tolerant and CostEffective Alloys for Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Systems."

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments. The goal of the proposed research effort is the realization of new strategies for resisting hydrogen embrittlement at extreme temperatures.

The potential impact of the work is in the hypothesis that SDs in HOTIs can host 1D quantum matter, given that HOTIs exhibit topologically protected states at hinges or corners and screw dislocations act naturally as an \u201cinternal\u201d boundary of a crystal. Theoretical calculations confirm this hypothesis by showing helical topological states in screw dislocations. These topological line states reside deep in the bandgap of HOTIs, leading to enhanced quantum coherence, which is critical to realizing fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this work, SDs are synthesized by stacking two single-crystalline nanomembranes (NMs) with controlled twist angles, followed by heat treatment. Tuning the thickness of the membrane, boundary conditions, and twist angle between the two NMs will systematically and deterministically change the periodicity, width, and orientation of the dislocations. The focus will be on Bi and Bi compounds (e.g., BiSb and BiTe) as they have previously been shown to host high-order topological states theoretically and experimentally. The research will integrate synthesis and structural characterization (both in-situ and ex-situ) of SDs in HOTI NMs. NMs provide access to a wide array of boundary conditions, including free vs. fixed and planar vs. non-planar surface boundaries. In addition, by varying the thickness of the NM, one can tailor the distance between the nucleation site of a SD (i.e., an interfacial twist boundary) and a surface boundary with arbitrary characteristics. Numerous theoretical models suggest that changes in the elastic energy and crystalline structure at surface boundaries may play a significant role in determining the kinetics of SDs\u2019 growth from interfacial twist boundaries as well as the structure of individual SDs and their networks. Despite a wealth of theoretical reports on the boundary-controlled behavior of dislocations, a comprehensive experimental study of this important aspect has not been carried out. Thus, there is no deterministic control and fundamental understanding of boundary-controlled nucleation, growth, and mobility of SDs in any ultra-thin material, including HOTIs.

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments. The goal of the proposed research effort is the realization of new strategies for resisting hydrogen embrittlement at extreme temperatures.

          "public_abstract": "Scientists are developing a method to efficiently produce hydrogen fuel from water using special photocatalyst materials that harness sunlight. Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design. This technique will be complemented with ultrafast spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or a gas analyzer, and computer simulation. The gas detection generated by SPR will be compared with GC-MS to establish an experimental relationship between simultaneous temperature and gas detection in SPR imaging. Ultra-fast measurements and computer simulations, incorporating advanced physics and chemistry models, will be employed to observe how rapidly these materials generate gas. The measurements will monitor the process from extremely brief moments to longer durations. This will enhance our understanding of heat transfer through the material, which is essential for improving process efficiency. The research outcome will be significant as it allows simultaneous measurement of temperature and gas generation from nanoparticles, providing a direct relationship between thermal energy and hydrogen generation.

Inspired by this behavior in living systems, we will conceptualize, create and investigate new bioinspired materials, which convert energy inputs into a wide variety of actions, which are controlled by external or environmental stimuli and through self-regulation. In particular, we will develop materials systems that have as their central elements responsive microcapsules composed of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) \u2013 elastic, stretchable and deformable materials equipped with the ability to respond to temperature and light. Each individual capsule is a microactuator; it can act as a standalone entity, as a member of a collective or swarm, or as a part of a composite material containing multiple, individually addressable actuators positioned within an active fiber. The fiber itself can also be designed to respond to stimuli by reconfiguring, reshaping, and carrying out useful work, all through controlled and/or self-regulated energy transduction mechanisms converting inputs of temperature and light into active mechanical outputs. These individual LCE capsules can be fabricated on scale, with different compositions, sizes, types and amounts of encased light-responsive elements, and, critically, with locally or globally imposed molecular alignment of the mesogens - the key moieties responsible for the various LCEs\u2019 reconfiguration patterns. Our approaches will allow us to create these capsules with a range of shapes, from spherical to various finely controlled geometries, (with different degrees of ellipticity, as cylinders, drums or dog-bones) that display individual or ensemble modes of deformation. We will investigate the unique features of these capsules to develop spore-like surface buckling patterns and to grow tentacle-like structures. We anticipate that the growth behavior will be highly dependent not only on the nature and overall shape of the microcapsules, but also on imposed buckling patterns, which will break symmetry in the system.

Mundy, Assistant Professor Department of Physics Harvard University Cambridge, MA 02139 Superconducting materials hold great promise for applications in energy generation, storage, and distribution. However, known superconductors still lack the transition temperatures, critical fields, or pairing symmetry to be fully exploited for these applications. This has not only continued to motivate the optimization of known superconducting materials, but further driven efforts for the discovery of new families of superconductors. This Early Career program will exploit the characteristics of the copper oxide-based superconductors as design criteria in the search for additional new materials that could host high-temperature superconductivity. The plan is to design, synthesize, and probe with atomic-scale precision metastable nickelate and cobaltate thin films. This work will tackle two intertwined synthesis challenges: 1) how does one control the local oxygen coordination and environment in a complex oxide material during synthesis and 2) how does one monitor and manipulate changes to the oxygen coordination post-synthesis. In both thrusts, new synthetic techniques are proposed that will allow reaching previously unexplored compounds. While the main work will focus on developing specific techniques for the stabilization and exploration of hypothesized superconductors, it is notable that the ability to create novel oxygen coordination environments should have broader impacts for a variety of non-perovskite oxide materials. ."

David Schall (North Carolina A&T State University); Nicolas Argibay, Duane Johnson, Ryan Ott, Prashant Singh, Iver Anderson, and Jun Cui (DOE Ames National Laboratory Ames). Use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, is ubiquitous in our daily lives, including powering automobiles, generating electricity and heating homes. However, use of this non-renewable resource results in a primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In the Department of Energy's energy roadmap hydrogen is identified as an important energy source to reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. Understanding the impact of prolonged hydrogen exposure on structural materials performance and developing hydrogen-tolerant materials that can survive exposure to the extreme environments associated with hydrogen storage, production, and use are emergent needs to enable a sustainable and economical hydrogen infrastructure. However, rapid diffusivity of hydrogen in metals, high chemical reactivity of metals with hydrogen, and the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement make the design of hydrogen-tolerant alloys very challenging. With the US\u2019s pursuit to create and scale a new hydrogen infrastructure, there will be an immediate need for a skilled energy science workforce. Concurrently, there is a need to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community, which requires recruitment, training, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. To address both these significant technical and socioeconomic challenges, this project will embrace interfaces and diversity in the scientific and social contexts by studying a diverse set of material-hydrogen interfacial problems, at the interface between diverse disciplines, and by bringing together students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty from institutions that serve underrepresented groups. The underlying science driver of this research project is the understanding of hydrogen interactions at interfaces, including crystal and phase boundaries. Research results will reveal how atomic-through-microscale structures, composition, and crystallographic orientation affect the properties of alloys when exposed to hydrogen environments.

          "public_abstract": "Scientists are developing a method to efficiently produce hydrogen fuel from water using special photocatalyst materials that harness sunlight. Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design. This technique will be complemented with ultrafast spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or a gas analyzer, and computer simulation. The gas detection generated by SPR will be compared with GC-MS to establish an experimental relationship between simultaneous temperature and gas detection in SPR imaging. Ultra-fast measurements and computer simulations, incorporating advanced physics and chemistry models, will be employed to observe how rapidly these materials generate gas. The measurements will monitor the process from extremely brief moments to longer durations. This will enhance our understanding of heat transfer through the material, which is essential for improving process efficiency. The research outcome will be significant as it allows simultaneous measurement of temperature and gas generation from nanoparticles, providing a direct relationship between thermal energy and hydrogen generation. It will clarify the primary mechanism in enhanced hydrogen generation. This technique has applications in various fields, including clean energy, medicine, and chemical processes.

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions.

We will utilize deep learning (DL) to improve plant trait parameterization for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) coupled to a next-generation dynamic vegetation model, the Functionally Assembled TErrestrial Simulator (FATES). The project seeks to understand (i) how soil, topography, and other environmental variables influence plant hydraulics, growth, and mortality parameters; (ii) relative importance and uncertainty sources of these parameters; and (iii) characteristics of plant hydraulic parameters, such as time-dependence and identifiability. Building on our previous and preliminary work, a major contribution of the research is a novel and highly efficient parameter learning framework for estimating environment-dependent and scale-dependent vegetation trait parameters with uncertainty estimations. This framework, saving four orders-of-magnitude of computational time, can be applied instantly on large scales, and has very competitive and potentially stronger optimization metrics than current optimization algorithms. It can be said that, instead of solving one inversion problem at a time, our framework will train a tool that solves this problem with higher efficient and more robust results. Additionally, this framework opens fresh pathways to address issues and ask new questions from a data-driven perspective. We will reduce uncertainty and improve physical significance of parameters by imposing novel constraints, such as information-transfer (parameters are roughly functions of plant types and environmental covariates) and covariation (exploiting observed inter-parameter relationships). At the same time, local heterogeneities in traits can be expressed, allowing us to understand the relative importance of stochasticity and environmental controls of plant traits. By interrogating the trained parameter learning model, we will reveal the linkages between topography, grid scale, soil, climate, and plant hydraulic traits, growth, and mortality parameters.

These changes pose direct risks to current and future human generations, especially socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of these ecosystem changes, and what kinds of actions would improve outcomes, requires new collaborations that bring together researchers in physical and biological sciences to test hypotheses with landscape-scale experiments. Addressing these issues also compels strong and sustained investment in inclusive training for scientists representing all affected human communities. To meet these needs, this project will advance new and long-term partnerships between faculty and students at Western Colorado University and researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley and SLAC National Accelerator Labs, focusing on the meeting the two key objectives. First, we will develop collaborative research on climate-driven impacts to ecosystems and watershed system functionality, linking forests to floodplains in western Colorado. Second, we will create new educational opportunities that provide innovative training to diverse students through immersion in real-time research that can provide new knowledge essential to improved social and ecological outcomes. Over a four year timeframe, we will develop a suite of synergistic research activities linking current and planned DOE research in watershed function with Western\u2019s growing expertise in ecological and environmental sciences and engagement with land management agencies planning large-scale interventions. Together, these endeavors will allow us to test hypotheses around effects of disturbances such as fire, novel silvicultural treatments, and stream restoration, on ecosystem function under a changing climate.

          "public_abstract": "This project aims to advance MultiSector Dynamics (MSD) research and methods by enhancing and combining multi-disciplinary tools, analytic methods, and visualization platforms to explore the implications of influences, stressors, and risks for complex interconnected physical and socio-economic systems. An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually. It is home to many strong connections between land, water, energy, and transportation as well as subject to multiple extreme events (e.g. floods, droughts and heat waves) and other abrupt and gradual changes (e.g. related to economic and population growth, energy transitions, land use changes, demand changes, etc.), making it well-suited for MSD research. Using this geographic area to focus the research, we willpursue a broader goal of better understanding forces and patterns, stabilities and instabilities, foresight, and the resilience of co-evolving systems in the context of multiple and compounding human and environmental stressors. In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales.

The overarching goal is to understand how water adopts distinct properties when placed in contact with different surfaces. Key surfaces examined are clay minerals and related solids (e.g., mica) that play central roles in soil health and subsurface energy, including in soil resilience to erosion and drought, geologic CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste isolation, and enhanced geothermal energy. The approach followed in the project uses high-performance computing, supported by atomistic-level experimental characterization, to elucidate the nanoscale properties of water in clay interlayer nanopores and in adsorbed water films on mica and silica surfaces. In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to reveal the behavior of individual atoms in complex systems (where spectroscopic and other experimental methods probe the average behavior of large numbers of atoms or molecules) and the manner in which the collective properties of assemblages of millions of water molecules emerge from atomistic-level interactions. A first major focus of the project is on understanding the selective transport properties of water-filled nanopores. In other words, how do nanopores selectively transport water vs. salt, or cations vs. anions? A second major focus is on understanding the stability of adsorbed water films on mineral surfaces. Finally, a third focus is on advancing MD simulation capabilities by combining simulations with synchrotron X-ray reflectivity and Terahertz spectroscopy experiments. The research relies on simulations carried out at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a US Department of Energy facility located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and on Princeton University\u2019s high-performance computing clusters. The project involves collaborations with scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the University of Ruhr-Bochum. A key projected outcome is the critical re-examination of existing models and theories used to describe the properties of water in nanopores and thin films, including models of water and solute transport in nanopores and models of disjoining pressure in adsorbed water films.

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales. The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities.

These changes pose direct risks to current and future human generations, especially socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of these ecosystem changes, and what kinds of actions would improve outcomes, requires new collaborations that bring together researchers in physical and biological sciences to test hypotheses with landscape-scale experiments. Addressing these issues also compels strong and sustained investment in inclusive training for scientists representing all affected human communities. To meet these needs, this project will advance new and long-term partnerships between faculty and students at Western Colorado University and researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley and SLAC National Accelerator Labs, focusing on the meeting the two key objectives. First, we will develop collaborative research on climate-driven impacts to ecosystems and watershed system functionality, linking forests to floodplains in western Colorado. Second, we will create new educational opportunities that provide innovative training to diverse students through immersion in real-time research that can provide new knowledge essential to improved social and ecological outcomes. Over a four year timeframe, we will develop a suite of synergistic research activities linking current and planned DOE research in watershed function with Western\u2019s growing expertise in ecological and environmental sciences and engagement with land management agencies planning large-scale interventions. Together, these endeavors will allow us to test hypotheses around effects of disturbances such as fire, novel silvicultural treatments, and stream restoration, on ecosystem function under a changing climate. Our research will further serve as the foundation for three innovative and linked training initiatives at Western, a small, rural university uniquely situated to support students from underserved rural communities in western Colorado.

          "public_abstract": "This project aims to advance MultiSector Dynamics (MSD) research and methods by enhancing and combining multi-disciplinary tools, analytic methods, and visualization platforms to explore the implications of influences, stressors, and risks for complex interconnected physical and socio-economic systems. An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually. It is home to many strong connections between land, water, energy, and transportation as well as subject to multiple extreme events (e.g. floods, droughts and heat waves) and other abrupt and gradual changes (e.g. related to economic and population growth, energy transitions, land use changes, demand changes, etc.), making it well-suited for MSD research. Using this geographic area to focus the research, we willpursue a broader goal of better understanding forces and patterns, stabilities and instabilities, foresight, and the resilience of co-evolving systems in the context of multiple and compounding human and environmental stressors. In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales. The research includes three overarching tasks: (1) advancing our multi-system modeling framework, with specific emphasis on our multi-system risk triage platform, a new scenario discovery visualization tool and methods for extreme event prediction; (2) investigating a set of use cases in the Mississippi River Basin with focus on (a) human-natural system interactions and upstream-downstream dynamics, and (b) transportation infrastructure in multisector systems; and (3) stress-testing interconnected systems in the Basin by bringing together components of the use cases to test strategic pairings in order to investigate compounding stressors, propagating risks, tipping points and resilience. Throughout these tasks we will explore the generalizability and extensibility of both MSD tools and insights while advancing MSD understanding and frontier methods/tools. We expect this project to have a broad range of impacts. It will result in new methods, tools, and an integrated multi-system modeling framework that includes new linkages among systems, sectors and scales. This will advance the frontier of MSD capabilities, while developing better understanding of cross-scale modeling and model interoperability. A subset of the tools developed will be interactive community platforms that can be used by a range of researchers and decision-makers. Application of these tools to the use cases will provide new insights into the Mississippi River Basin, while also pushing the boundaries of MSD research into new areas, including transportation and important human-natural interactions related to air and water quality, human health and well-being. The stress-testing of paired systems will provide understanding of system-of-systems responses to compounding stresses and how the scope of study can affect individual sector/system outcomes and responses. In addition, the project will foster stronger collaboration within the MSD community of practice, and advance MSD understanding, capabilities and generalizable insights."

Microorganisms involved in N-cycling in forest soils are major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO) to the atmosphere. These gases are both air pollutants and greenhouse gas precursors. However, we do not know the specific microbial populations and genetic systems responsible for these emissions, making it challenging to predict their contributions to global atmospheric change.

This research team will use a novel approach to investigate the microbial origins of these emissions across forests of varying mesophication stages. This new research is driven by several hypotheses: (1) Soil moisture and N are the primary drivers of microbial emissions of NOx/HONO in forest ecosystems.

(2) In mesic (i.e., moist) forest soils, higher N levels from more easily decomposed leaf litter and increased water runoff from trees contribute to greater NOx/HONO emissions.

The team will analyze the soil microbial communities using DNA sequencing techniques and measure other factors such as soil moisture, N levels, and NO?/HONO emissions from the soil. They will also track the unique isotopic \"fingerprints\" of these gases (using nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18 isotopes) to determine their sources. In the laboratory, for Objective 2, the researchers will test soil samples taken from this study site to understand how past fire activity influences the release of NO?/HONO gases. In Objective 3, the team will measure the specific isotopic signatures (nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18) of the NO?/HONO gases produced by different types of microorganisms. This will help them identify the specific microbial processes responsible for producing these gases in the field. Finally, in Objective 4, the researchers will use these findings from Objectives 1-3 to build a biogeochemical model that estimates how much NO?/HONO is released from soils under different fire conditions. This model will feed into an atmospheric model to predict how these emissions will impact the climate of the region. Key outcomes of the research include a detailed analysis of soil microbial communities across forests experiencing different levels of fire suppression and resulting mesophication. The study will describe how changes in these microbial populations are connected to the release of NO?/HONO. Researchers will also determine how specific soil microbial processes, such as denitrification and nitrification, contribute to the production of these gases. Additionally, the team will create a computer model that incorporates isotope data to simulate how nitrogen cycles through the environment and estimate the natural emissions of NO?/HONO from forest soils at various stages of mesophication. Using these results, they will run simulations to understand how changes in fire management and microbial populations affect atmospheric chemistry and, ultimately, the climate. These findings will be important for both climate modeling and forest management, especially as forests in the eastern U.S. become increasingly dominated by mesic, fire-suppressed conditions."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools.

Expected Outcomes: The integration of high-resolution observations (atmospheric, land surface, and infrastructure), diagnostic and predictive models, and civic engagement will provide new knowledge and deliver next-generation predictive tools that are regionally specific but also translatable to other arid regions. Ultimately, the new tools will empower the public to respond to extreme heat, while informing the development and deployment of policies and solutions that are effective, equitable and generalizable."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge.

The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities. Expected Outcomes: The integration of high-resolution observations (atmospheric, land surface, and infrastructure), diagnostic and predictive models, and civic engagement will provide new knowledge and deliver next-generation predictive tools that are regionally specific but also translatable to other arid regions. Ultimately, the new tools will empower the public to respond to extreme heat, while informing the development and deployment of policies and solutions that are effective, equitable and generalizable."

          "public_abstract": "In forests of the eastern United States, wildfire suppression policies have significantly changed the tree structure, soil composition, and moisture levels, a process known as \"mesophication\". \u201cMesic\u201d forest soils have increased moisture content and nutrient availability. These mesophication-associated changes are expected to have a major impact on soil nitrogen (N) cycling by microorganisms. Microorganisms involved in N-cycling in forest soils are major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO) to the atmosphere. These gases are both air pollutants and greenhouse gas precursors. However, we do not know the specific microbial populations and genetic systems responsible for these emissions, making it challenging to predict their contributions to global atmospheric change. Additionally, the specific populations of microorganisms that produce these gases likely vary across ecosystems. Thus, forest ecosystems at different stages of mesophication provide a unique opportunity to study how different environmental factors like soil moisture and nutrient content influence microbial production of NOx/HONO. This research team will use a novel approach to investigate the microbial origins of these emissions across forests of varying mesophication stages. This new research is driven by several hypotheses: (1) Soil moisture and N are the primary drivers of microbial emissions of NOx/HONO in forest ecosystems. Both variables will increase alongside the degree of forest mesophication. (2) In mesic (i.e., moist) forest soils, higher N levels from more easily decomposed leaf litter and increased water runoff from trees contribute to greater NOx/HONO emissions. (3) The high moisture levels in these soil conditions create small oxygen-deprived zones where anaerobic microorganisms become the main source of NOx/HONO emissions. (4) Emissions from these microbial processes have a significant impact on regional air quality and atmospheric chemistry across the eastern United States. In Objective 1 of this project, the research team will study how biological, chemical, and physical factors affect the release of NO?/HONO from soils in forests with high to low degrees of mesophication. The team will focus on different forest plots at the Catoosa Wildlife Management Area (Crossville, TN, USA), which represent a variety of fire management practices\u2014ranging from no burns at all (i.e., mesic, or moist, conditions) to frequent, controlled burns (i.e., xeric, or drier, conditions).

However, the United States (US) faces significant challenges: many graduating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, enter the workforce without the necessary skills, hands-on experience, and research expertise in AI and HPC. The lack of adequately trained graduates impedes the nation\u2019s ability to drive innovation and achieve strategic objectives. To address the challenges, this project aims to build a regional AI community through collaborative research and traineeship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to provide students with comprehensive training in AI with HPC, equipping them with the technical expertise and practical experience needed to excel in these fields. This project has seven key objectives: (i) Establish a regional community for sustainable traineeship collaboration between Maryland institutions and the DOE lab, including shared infrastructure, cross-mentored research projects, and integrated educational resources; (ii) Train and prepare students for the future AI workforce by providing students with hands-on research experience with DOE Lab\u2019s AI projects, fostering practical skills, expertise in real-world applications, and the ability to collaborate effectively within team settings; (iii) Provide students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research projects, guided by experienced faculty and DOE scientists; (iv) Facilitate students\u2019 professional development through workshops, seminars, hackathons, and training sessions that equip students with the latest AI technologies, industry-standard tools, and ethical considerations; (v) Enhance course contents and design new course modules at the participating institutions to reflect the latest advancements in AI and incorporate practical experiences that align with industry needs; (vi) Recruit and support students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field and ensuring a wide range of perspectives in AI development; (vii) Establish long-term research collaborations between students, faculty, and DOE scientists to address critical AI challenges and advance scientific knowledge. This project is anticipated to mentor and support around 27 students over three years. Working in teams, students will collaborate with scientists at LBNL, contributing to studies that advance AI and HPC. The student participants will receive comprehensive financial support throughout the academic year and summer. Faculty and DOE scientists will hold regular mentoring meetings with student research teams. The curriculum at the participating institutions will be improved through collaboration with LBNL scientists, integrating state-of-the-art research and projects to better prepare students for careers in the AI workforce. This sustainable model ensures the long-term continuation of AI education excellence, aligning with the evolving needs in AI and HPC, as well as the DOE\u2019s mission.

These changes pose direct risks to current and future human generations, especially socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of these ecosystem changes, and what kinds of actions would improve outcomes, requires new collaborations that bring together researchers in physical and biological sciences to test hypotheses with landscape-scale experiments. Addressing these issues also compels strong and sustained investment in inclusive training for scientists representing all affected human communities. To meet these needs, this project will advance new and long-term partnerships between faculty and students at Western Colorado University and researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley and SLAC National Accelerator Labs, focusing on the meeting the two key objectives. First, we will develop collaborative research on climate-driven impacts to ecosystems and watershed system functionality, linking forests to floodplains in western Colorado. Second, we will create new educational opportunities that provide innovative training to diverse students through immersion in real-time research that can provide new knowledge essential to improved social and ecological outcomes. Over a four year timeframe, we will develop a suite of synergistic research activities linking current and planned DOE research in watershed function with Western\u2019s growing expertise in ecological and environmental sciences and engagement with land management agencies planning large-scale interventions. Together, these endeavors will allow us to test hypotheses around effects of disturbances such as fire, novel silvicultural treatments, and stream restoration, on ecosystem function under a changing climate. Our research will further serve as the foundation for three innovative and linked training initiatives at Western, a small, rural university uniquely situated to support students from underserved rural communities in western Colorado. These include: a) a new Environmental Science program that immerses diverse students directly into cutting-edge research, b) expanded fellowship opportunities for underrepresented and first-generation students in Western\u2019s MS and MEM programs, and c) mentoring and curriculum that builds data and narratives from our research activities into engaging classroom materials and activities. The initiatives we propose will advance critical science questions and provide inclusive training for students who would not otherwise have access to such opportunities. These in turn will facilitate the development of long-term partnerships between DOE and a rural university, to link the next generation of diverse, innovative scientists to fulfilling career opportunities addressing environmental challenges."

However, there is a limited participation of minority students in nuclear physics research due to the lack of financial support during the academic year. Therefore, this proposal seeks to enhance the participation of minority undergraduate students in nuclear science by providing financial stability throughout the whole year which allows them to concentrate on their research. The GSU nuclear physics group is working on several research projects at the forefront of nuclear physics. These projects are carried out at national facilities (i.e. Brookhaven National Laboratory, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and National Institute of Standards and Technology) as well as locally, and include building the hadronic calorimeter for the sPHENIX experiment, carrying data analysis on the data collected by the PHENIX detector, building and designing modular RICH Aerogel prototype of particle identification detector for Electron-Ion Collider experiments, and building and running cosmic ray detector units. In addition, there are also near future projects such as sPHENIX and NSR experiments. The breadth of these research projects and the GSU group\u2019s experience in mentoring undergraduate and graduate student work, especially with women and minorities provide excellent research opportunities for the students to learn valuable skills utilized in all aspects of research including detector construction, data collection and analysis, and dissemination."

However, the United States (US) faces significant challenges: many graduating students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, enter the workforce without the necessary skills, hands-on experience, and research expertise in AI and HPC. The lack of adequately trained graduates impedes the nation\u2019s ability to drive innovation and achieve strategic objectives. To address the challenges, this project aims to build a regional AI community through collaborative research and traineeship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to provide students with comprehensive training in AI with HPC, equipping them with the technical expertise and practical experience needed to excel in these fields. This project has seven key objectives: (i) Establish a regional community for sustainable traineeship collaboration between Maryland institutions and the DOE lab, including shared infrastructure, cross-mentored research projects, and integrated educational resources; (ii) Train and prepare students for the future AI workforce by providing students with hands-on research experience with DOE Lab\u2019s AI projects, fostering practical skills, expertise in real-world applications, and the ability to collaborate effectively within team settings; (iii) Provide students with opportunities to engage in meaningful research projects, guided by experienced faculty and DOE scientists; (iv) Facilitate students\u2019 professional development through workshops, seminars, hackathons, and training sessions that equip students with the latest AI technologies, industry-standard tools, and ethical considerations; (v) Enhance course contents and design new course modules at the participating institutions to reflect the latest advancements in AI and incorporate practical experiences that align with industry needs; (vi) Recruit and support students from underrepresented groups to participate in the program, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field and ensuring a wide range of perspectives in AI development; (vii) Establish long-term research collaborations between students, faculty, and DOE scientists to address critical AI challenges and advance scientific knowledge. This project is anticipated to mentor and support around 27 students over three years. Working in teams, students will collaborate with scientists at LBNL, contributing to studies that advance AI and HPC. The student participants will receive comprehensive financial support throughout the academic year and summer. Faculty and DOE scientists will hold regular mentoring meetings with student research teams. The curriculum at the participating institutions will be improved through collaboration with LBNL scientists, integrating state-of-the-art research and projects to better prepare students for careers in the AI workforce. This sustainable model ensures the long-term continuation of AI education excellence, aligning with the evolving needs in AI and HPC, as well as the DOE\u2019s mission.

These changes pose direct risks to current and future human generations, especially socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of these ecosystem changes, and what kinds of actions would improve outcomes, requires new collaborations that bring together researchers in physical and biological sciences to test hypotheses with landscape-scale experiments. Addressing these issues also compels strong and sustained investment in inclusive training for scientists representing all affected human communities. To meet these needs, this project will advance new and long-term partnerships between faculty and students at Western Colorado University and researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley and SLAC National Accelerator Labs, focusing on the meeting the two key objectives. First, we will develop collaborative research on climate-driven impacts to ecosystems and watershed system functionality, linking forests to floodplains in western Colorado. Second, we will create new educational opportunities that provide innovative training to diverse students through immersion in real-time research that can provide new knowledge essential to improved social and ecological outcomes. Over a four year timeframe, we will develop a suite of synergistic research activities linking current and planned DOE research in watershed function with Western\u2019s growing expertise in ecological and environmental sciences and engagement with land management agencies planning large-scale interventions. Together, these endeavors will allow us to test hypotheses around effects of disturbances such as fire, novel silvicultural treatments, and stream restoration, on ecosystem function under a changing climate. Our research will further serve as the foundation for three innovative and linked training initiatives at Western, a small, rural university uniquely situated to support students from underserved rural communities in western Colorado. These include: a) a new Environmental Science program that immerses diverse students directly into cutting-edge research, b) expanded fellowship opportunities for underrepresented and first-generation students in Western\u2019s MS and MEM programs, and c) mentoring and curriculum that builds data and narratives from our research activities into engaging classroom materials and activities. The initiatives we propose will advance critical science questions and provide inclusive training for students who would not otherwise have access to such opportunities. These in turn will facilitate the development of long-term partnerships between DOE and a rural university, to link the next generation of diverse, innovative scientists to fulfilling career opportunities addressing environmental challenges."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales. The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions.

An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually. It is home to many strong connections between land, water, energy, and transportation as well as subject to multiple extreme events (e.g. floods, droughts and heat waves) and other abrupt and gradual changes (e.g. related to economic and population growth, energy transitions, land use changes, demand changes, etc.), making it well-suited for MSD research. Using this geographic area to focus the research, we willpursue a broader goal of better understanding forces and patterns, stabilities and instabilities, foresight, and the resilience of co-evolving systems in the context of multiple and compounding human and environmental stressors. In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales.

This will advance the frontier of MSD capabilities, while developing better understanding of cross-scale modeling and model interoperability. A subset of the tools developed will be interactive community platforms that can be used by a range of researchers and decision-makers. Application of these tools to the use cases will provide new insights into the Mississippi River Basin, while also pushing the boundaries of MSD research into new areas, including transportation and important human-natural interactions related to air and water quality, human health and well-being. The stress-testing of paired systems will provide understanding of system-of-systems responses to compounding stresses and how the scope of study can affect individual sector/system outcomes and responses. In addition, the project will foster stronger collaboration within the MSD community of practice, and advance MSD understanding, capabilities and generalizable insights."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge.

This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities. Expected Outcomes: The integration of high-resolution observations (atmospheric, land surface, and infrastructure), diagnostic and predictive models, and civic engagement will provide new knowledge and deliver next-generation predictive tools that are regionally specific but also translatable to other arid regions. Ultimately, the new tools will empower the public to respond to extreme heat, while informing the development and deployment of policies and solutions that are effective, equitable and generalizable."

          "public_abstract": "Significant uncertainties in the surface radiation budget in Earth system models (ESMs) exist over the Southern Ocean. As model output is sensitive to parameterizations of mixed-phase and ice cloud processes, and as cloud reflective properties are sensitive to liquid, mixed-phase and ice cloud properties, that in turn are influenced by aerosol properties and large scale meteorological conditions, it is critical to improve understanding of key aerosol, cloud, precipitation and radiative transfer processes. However, model parameterizations are challenged to adequately represent cloud and aerosol processes due to minimal observations existing over the Southern Ocean. Data collected in prior Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program (DOE ARM)-supported field campaigns over the Southern Ocean show large seasonal variations, significant supercooled liquid water, and frequent precipitation below cloud base. But the representativeness of these findings for the entire Southern Ocean is not known because data have been obtained in only a few locations and exhibit latitudinal trends and dependence on synoptic conditions. Thus, this project will use observations from the Cloud and Precipitation Experiment at kennaook (CAPE-k) project to examine controls on aerosol and cloud properties, including those of mixed-phase and ice clouds, over the Southern Ocean. Using CAPE-k data supplemented with data from the Measurements of Aerosols Radiation and Clouds over the Southern Ocean (MARCUS), Macquarie Island Cloud Radiation Experiment (MICRE), and Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) we will analyze how cloud, precipitation and radiative properties depend on season and on aerosol and meteorological conditions to test these hypotheses: 1) Given meteorological constraints, radiative biases in models are dominated by the representation of mixed-phase cloud processes over the Southern Ocean; 2) At similar surface temperatures and latitudes, systematic differences between Arctic and Southern Ocean clouds cloud properties exist and are more closely linked to environmental conditions than aerosol amount; 3) The concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei and aerosols are more correlated with precipitation presence than with surface wind speeds regardless of large scale meteorological conditions or geographic location; 4) Liquid, ice, and mixed-phase cloud and precipitation properties of boundary layer clouds are more closely correlated with cloud-base and mid-cloud updrafts and environmental conditions than to variations in accumulation mode aerosol concentrations; 5) The presence of ice in drizzle over the Southern Ocean is better correlated with cloud updraft velocity than with accumulation aerosol or ice nucleating particle concentrations; We will use data from in-situ aerosol, thermodynamic, meteorological, ground-based precipitation probes, radar, lidar, and radiometer sensors from CAPE-k and the kennaook station to derive and retrieve aerosol and cloud microphysical properties, heights, coverage and updraft speeds. We will develop a value-added product of environmental conditions including temperature, lower atmospheric stability, estimated inversion strength, cold air outbreak index, convective available potential energy, wind speed and direction, air mass origin, meteorological regime, cloud coupling to boundary layer, and closed/open cell classification. Multivariate statistical tests will determine significance of correlations between cloud, aerosol and dynamical properties and dependence on environmental conditions, and used to evaluate simulations. Simulations will examine how cloud, precipitation and radiative properties depend on the environment and aerosols, and explore how the representation of cloud microphysics, the boundary layer, and surface fluxes affects radiative fluxes in models at various scales using the DOE-supported models, Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Single Column Model (SCM) and Doubly Periodic Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model (DP-SCREAM).

Past studies on land-sea breeze circulation were often limited to large tropical islands, relied primarily on reanalysis/model outputs, and overlooked the diurnal variation in moist static energy (MSE), crucial for understanding tropical convection dynamics. Recently, DOE\u2019s ARM facility released 15-years (2000-2014) of value-added radiosonde and microwave radiometer products (INTERPSONDE) that provide sub-hourly vertical profiles of winds (zonal and meridional), temperature, relative humidity, and pressure.

Kumjian, The Pennsylvania State University Co-Investigators: Romit Maulik, The Pennsylvania State University Unfunded Collaborators: Virendra Ghate, Argonne National Laboratory Deep convective clouds play crucial roles in our climate by contributing to Earth's energy budget, water cycle, and vertical transport of winds, heat, moisture, and aerosol particles. Thus, it is important to accurately represent them in computer models of all scales. However, the immense complexity of processes in these clouds coupled with a lack of robust observations within them impede understanding and produce significant uncertainties in the ways our models represent them. Detailed, direct observations are critically needed to improve our understanding of these processes and to provide guidance for representing these processes in models. Fortunately, the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) field campaign, which took place in Houston, Texas, provided such much-needed observational datasets tailored for convective cloud processes. For the first time, a radar deployed as part of this campaign operated in a special storm-tracking mode that allowed it to collect thousands of high-resolution scans of deep convective clouds. This novel dataset is paired with high-resolution measurements of the environment in the vicinity these clouds collected from frequent weather balloon launches and diverse surface and profiling instruments. We will use this unprecedented quantity and quality of information to elucidate the clouds\u2019 mixed-phase processes \u2013 i.e., those involving liquid and ice particles or hydrometeors \u2013 across cloud lifecycles and environments. By doing so, we will address the following science questions: What are the typical hydrometeor and wind structures of convective cloud mixed-phase regions? How are these structures related to the storm\u2019s intensity and parent environment? What are these structures' typical growth/decay pathways and timescales? Doing so will achieve the project's main objectives: Objective 1: Characterize the major radar signals in mixed-phase regions, quantify their relative importance (in terms of explaining the variance) across the entire dataset, and provide interpretations of the microphysical and kinematic processes they represent. Objective 2: Quantify how these major structures vary across environments sampled during the field campaign, and determine their correlation with radar-based measures of storm intensity. Objective 3: Quantify the frequency content associated with these structures, their growth rates, how their emergence is related to radar-based measures of storm intensity, and their timescales.

An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually. It is home to many strong connections between land, water, energy, and transportation as well as subject to multiple extreme events (e.g. floods, droughts and heat waves) and other abrupt and gradual changes (e.g. related to economic and population growth, energy transitions, land use changes, demand changes, etc.), making it well-suited for MSD research. Using this geographic area to focus the research, we willpursue a broader goal of better understanding forces and patterns, stabilities and instabilities, foresight, and the resilience of co-evolving systems in the context of multiple and compounding human and environmental stressors. In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales.

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales. The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities.

          "public_abstract": "Significant uncertainties in the surface radiation budget in Earth system models (ESMs) exist over the Southern Ocean. As model output is sensitive to parameterizations of mixed-phase and ice cloud processes, and as cloud reflective properties are sensitive to liquid, mixed-phase and ice cloud properties, that in turn are influenced by aerosol properties and large scale meteorological conditions, it is critical to improve understanding of key aerosol, cloud, precipitation and radiative transfer processes. However, model parameterizations are challenged to adequately represent cloud and aerosol processes due to minimal observations existing over the Southern Ocean. Data collected in prior Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program (DOE ARM)-supported field campaigns over the Southern Ocean show large seasonal variations, significant supercooled liquid water, and frequent precipitation below cloud base. But the representativeness of these findings for the entire Southern Ocean is not known because data have been obtained in only a few locations and exhibit latitudinal trends and dependence on synoptic conditions. Thus, this project will use observations from the Cloud and Precipitation Experiment at kennaook (CAPE-k) project to examine controls on aerosol and cloud properties, including those of mixed-phase and ice clouds, over the Southern Ocean. Using CAPE-k data supplemented with data from the Measurements of Aerosols Radiation and Clouds over the Southern Ocean (MARCUS), Macquarie Island Cloud Radiation Experiment (MICRE), and Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) we will analyze how cloud, precipitation and radiative properties depend on season and on aerosol and meteorological conditions to test these hypotheses: 1) Given meteorological constraints, radiative biases in models are dominated by the representation of mixed-phase cloud processes over the Southern Ocean; 2) At similar surface temperatures and latitudes, systematic differences between Arctic and Southern Ocean clouds cloud properties exist and are more closely linked to environmental conditions than aerosol amount; 3) The concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei and aerosols are more correlated with precipitation presence than with surface wind speeds regardless of large scale meteorological conditions or geographic location; 4) Liquid, ice, and mixed-phase cloud and precipitation properties of boundary layer clouds are more closely correlated with cloud-base and mid-cloud updrafts and environmental conditions than to variations in accumulation mode aerosol concentrations; 5) The presence of ice in drizzle over the Southern Ocean is better correlated with cloud updraft velocity than with accumulation aerosol or ice nucleating particle concentrations; We will use data from in-situ aerosol, thermodynamic, meteorological, ground-based precipitation probes, radar, lidar, and radiometer sensors from CAPE-k and the kennaook station to derive and retrieve aerosol and cloud microphysical properties, heights, coverage and updraft speeds. We will develop a value-added product of environmental conditions including temperature, lower atmospheric stability, estimated inversion strength, cold air outbreak index, convective available potential energy, wind speed and direction, air mass origin, meteorological regime, cloud coupling to boundary layer, and closed/open cell classification. Multivariate statistical tests will determine significance of correlations between cloud, aerosol and dynamical properties and dependence on environmental conditions, and used to evaluate simulations.

We will utilize deep learning (DL) to improve plant trait parameterization for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) coupled to a next-generation dynamic vegetation model, the Functionally Assembled TErrestrial Simulator (FATES). The project seeks to understand (i) how soil, topography, and other environmental variables influence plant hydraulics, growth, and mortality parameters; (ii) relative importance and uncertainty sources of these parameters; and (iii) characteristics of plant hydraulic parameters, such as time-dependence and identifiability. Building on our previous and preliminary work, a major contribution of the research is a novel and highly efficient parameter learning framework for estimating environment-dependent and scale-dependent vegetation trait parameters with uncertainty estimations. This framework, saving four orders-of-magnitude of computational time, can be applied instantly on large scales, and has very competitive and potentially stronger optimization metrics than current optimization algorithms. It can be said that, instead of solving one inversion problem at a time, our framework will train a tool that solves this problem with higher efficient and more robust results. Additionally, this framework opens fresh pathways to address issues and ask new questions from a data-driven perspective. We will reduce uncertainty and improve physical significance of parameters by imposing novel constraints, such as information-transfer (parameters are roughly functions of plant types and environmental covariates) and covariation (exploiting observed inter-parameter relationships). At the same time, local heterogeneities in traits can be expressed, allowing us to understand the relative importance of stochasticity and environmental controls of plant traits. By interrogating the trained parameter learning model, we will reveal the linkages between topography, grid scale, soil, climate, and plant hydraulic traits, growth, and mortality parameters.

Kumjian, The Pennsylvania State University Co-Investigators: Romit Maulik, The Pennsylvania State University Unfunded Collaborators: Virendra Ghate, Argonne National Laboratory Deep convective clouds play crucial roles in our climate by contributing to Earth's energy budget, water cycle, and vertical transport of winds, heat, moisture, and aerosol particles. Thus, it is important to accurately represent them in computer models of all scales. However, the immense complexity of processes in these clouds coupled with a lack of robust observations within them impede understanding and produce significant uncertainties in the ways our models represent them. Detailed, direct observations are critically needed to improve our understanding of these processes and to provide guidance for representing these processes in models. Fortunately, the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) field campaign, which took place in Houston, Texas, provided such much-needed observational datasets tailored for convective cloud processes. For the first time, a radar deployed as part of this campaign operated in a special storm-tracking mode that allowed it to collect thousands of high-resolution scans of deep convective clouds. This novel dataset is paired with high-resolution measurements of the environment in the vicinity these clouds collected from frequent weather balloon launches and diverse surface and profiling instruments. We will use this unprecedented quantity and quality of information to elucidate the clouds\u2019 mixed-phase processes \u2013 i.e., those involving liquid and ice particles or hydrometeors \u2013 across cloud lifecycles and environments. By doing so, we will address the following science questions: What are the typical hydrometeor and wind structures of convective cloud mixed-phase regions? How are these structures related to the storm\u2019s intensity and parent environment? What are these structures' typical growth/decay pathways and timescales? Doing so will achieve the project's main objectives: Objective 1: Characterize the major radar signals in mixed-phase regions, quantify their relative importance (in terms of explaining the variance) across the entire dataset, and provide interpretations of the microphysical and kinematic processes they represent. Objective 2: Quantify how these major structures vary across environments sampled during the field campaign, and determine their correlation with radar-based measures of storm intensity",

          "public_abstract": "Using Machine Learning to Uncover Deep Convective Cloud Processes with TRACER Observations Principal Investigator: Matthew R. Kumjian, The Pennsylvania State University Co-Investigators: Romit Maulik, The Pennsylvania State University Unfunded Collaborators: Virendra Ghate, Argonne National Laboratory Deep convective clouds play crucial roles in our climate by contributing to Earth's energy budget, water cycle, and vertical transport of winds, heat, moisture, and aerosol particles. Thus, it is important to accurately represent them in computer models of all scales. However, the immense complexity of processes in these clouds coupled with a lack of robust observations within them impede understanding and produce significant uncertainties in the ways our models represent them. Detailed, direct observations are critically needed to improve our understanding of these processes and to provide guidance for representing these processes in models. Fortunately, the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) field campaign, which took place in Houston, Texas, provided such much-needed observational datasets tailored for convective cloud processes. For the first time, a radar deployed as part of this campaign operated in a special storm-tracking mode that allowed it to collect thousands of high-resolution scans of deep convective clouds. This novel dataset is paired with high-resolution measurements of the environment in the vicinity these clouds collected from frequent weather balloon launches and diverse surface and profiling instruments. We will use this unprecedented quantity and quality of information to elucidate the clouds\u2019 mixed-phase processes \u2013 i.e., those involving liquid and ice particles or hydrometeors \u2013 across cloud lifecycles and environments. By doing so, we will address the following science questions: What are the typical hydrometeor and wind structures of convective cloud mixed-phase regions? How are these structures related to the storm\u2019s intensity and parent environment? What are these structures' typical growth/decay pathways and timescales? Doing so will achieve the project's main objectives: Objective 1: Characterize the major radar signals in mixed-phase regions, quantify their relative importance (in terms of explaining the variance) across the entire dataset, and provide interpretations of the microphysical and kinematic processes they represent. Objective 2: Quantify how these major structures vary across environments sampled during the field campaign, and determine their correlation with radar-based measures of storm intensity. Objective 3: Quantify the frequency content associated with these structures, their growth rates, how their emergence is related to radar-based measures of storm intensity, and their timescales. The sheer volume and complexity of the novel radar dataset necessitates new tools and a \"big data\" analysis approach. To tackle this challenge, we have developed radar data preprocessing software that allows for extraction and recentering of isolated convective cloud \"snapshots.\" We will analyze these snapshots using high-performance machine learning methods, in which linear algebra techniques allow efficient coherent pattern extraction from large datasets, and analyses of cloud evolution. These tools will facilitate comparison of the clouds\u2019 coherent structures to individual scans to quantify when they emerge or disappear throughout the cloud\u2019s lifetime. We will utilize modal analyses techniques including proper orthogonal decomposition, dynamic mode decomposition, and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition on matrices constructed from the processed radar data. Our research will lead to a robust understanding of convective mixed-phase processes and quantification of their influence on observed cross-environment and cross-lifetime variability, providing useful benchmarks for cloud process representation in computer models ranging from small-scale ones that resolve individual convective clouds through large-scale ones that simulate the entire earth system. Improved understanding of how environments modulate storm intensity and mixed-phase region properties will aid in the development of representations of convective clouds and their processes in these models. Quantifying the spectral content of cells' coherent structures provides critical information on typical timescales and temporal relationships to other structures, painting a complete picture of convective processes through cloud lifetimes. Our research introduces powerful machine learning tools with broad applicability to the climate and atmospheric science community. Lessons learned from detailed analyses of the unprecedented radar dataset will lead to concrete recommendations for future implementations of these specialized radar scanning strategies. The cross-disciplinary nature of the proposed research and team serves as a bridge between two communities with complementary skills and expertise, fostering collaborations and new science."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools.

This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities. Expected Outcomes: The integration of high-resolution observations (atmospheric, land surface, and infrastructure), diagnostic and predictive models, and civic engagement will provide new knowledge and deliver next-generation predictive tools that are regionally specific but also translatable to other arid regions. Ultimately, the new tools will empower the public to respond to extreme heat, while informing the development and deployment of policies and solutions that are effective, equitable and generalizable."

In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales. The research includes three overarching tasks: (1) advancing our multi-system modeling framework, with specific emphasis on our multi-system risk triage platform, a new scenario discovery visualization tool and methods for extreme event prediction; (2) investigating a set of use cases in the Mississippi River Basin with focus on (a) human-natural system interactions and upstream-downstream dynamics, and (b) transportation infrastructure in multisector systems; and (3) stress-testing interconnected systems in the Basin by bringing together components of the use cases to test strategic pairings in order to investigate compounding stressors, propagating risks, tipping points and resilience. Throughout these tasks we will explore the generalizability and extensibility of both MSD tools and insights while advancing MSD understanding and frontier methods/tools. We expect this project to have a broad range of impacts. It will result in new methods, tools, and an integrated multi-system modeling framework that includes new linkages among systems, sectors and scales. This will advance the frontier of MSD capabilities, while developing better understanding of cross-scale modeling and model interoperability. A subset of the tools developed will be interactive community platforms that can be used by a range of researchers and decision-makers. Application of these tools to the use cases will provide new insights into the Mississippi River Basin, while also pushing the boundaries of MSD research into new areas, including transportation and important human-natural interactions related to air and water quality, human health and well-being. The stress-testing of paired systems will provide understanding of system-of-systems responses to compounding stresses and how the scope of study can affect individual sector/system outcomes and responses.

An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually. It is home to many strong connections between land, water, energy, and transportation as well as subject to multiple extreme events (e.g. floods, droughts and heat waves) and other abrupt and gradual changes (e.g. related to economic and population growth, energy transitions, land use changes, demand changes, etc.), making it well-suited for MSD research. Using this geographic area to focus the research, we willpursue a broader goal of better understanding forces and patterns, stabilities and instabilities, foresight, and the resilience of co-evolving systems in the context of multiple and compounding human and environmental stressors. In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales. The research includes three overarching tasks: (1) advancing our multi-system modeling framework, with specific emphasis on our multi-system risk triage platform, a new scenario discovery visualization tool and methods for extreme event prediction; (2) investigating a set of use cases in the Mississippi River Basin with focus on (a) human-natural system interactions and upstream-downstream dynamics, and (b) transportation infrastructure in multisector systems; and (3) stress-testing interconnected systems in the Basin by bringing together components of the use cases to test strategic pairings in order to investigate compounding stressors, propagating risks, tipping points and resilience. Throughout these tasks we will explore the generalizability and extensibility of both MSD tools and insights while advancing MSD understanding and frontier methods/tools. We expect this project to have a broad range of impacts. It will result in new methods, tools, and an integrated multi-system modeling framework that includes new linkages among systems, sectors and scales. This will advance the frontier of MSD capabilities, while developing better understanding of cross-scale modeling and model interoperability. A subset of the tools developed will be interactive community platforms that can be used by a range of researchers and decision-makers. Application of these tools to the use cases will provide new insights into the Mississippi River Basin, while also pushing the boundaries of MSD research into new areas, including transportation and important human-natural interactions related to air and water quality, human health and well-being. The stress-testing of paired systems will provide understanding of system-of-systems responses to compounding stresses and how the scope of study can affect individual sector/system outcomes and responses. In addition, the project will foster stronger collaboration within the MSD community of practice, and advance MSD understanding, capabilities and generalizable insights."

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions. While the hybrid earthquake scenario generator will provide an essential capability for ensuring the resiliency and cost-effectiveness of future energy systems to earthquake risk, the framework that will be developed as part of this project will open transformative possibilities to regional-scale distributed infrastructure system resilience assessment and risk reduction more broadly. Since the machine learning algorithms will be agnostic to the earthquake source and wave propagation physics that lie under the hood, we envision the hybridized framework as a stepping stone to assessing resilience and risk associated with other hazards threatening energy systems, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and combinations thereof."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools.

Expected Outcomes: The integration of high-resolution observations (atmospheric, land surface, and infrastructure), diagnostic and predictive models, and civic engagement will provide new knowledge and deliver next-generation predictive tools that are regionally specific but also translatable to other arid regions. Ultimately, the new tools will empower the public to respond to extreme heat, while informing the development and deployment of policies and solutions that are effective, equitable and generalizable."

An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually.

The sheer volume and complexity of the novel radar dataset necessitates new tools and a \"big data\" analysis approach. To tackle this challenge, we have developed radar data preprocessing software that allows for extraction and recentering of isolated convective cloud \"snapshots.\" We will analyze these snapshots using high-performance machine learning methods, in which linear algebra techniques allow efficient coherent pattern extraction from large datasets, and analyses of cloud evolution. These tools will facilitate comparison of the clouds\u2019 coherent structures to individual scans to quantify when they emerge or disappear throughout the cloud\u2019s lifetime. We will utilize modal analyses techniques including proper orthogonal decomposition, dynamic mode decomposition, and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition on matrices constructed from the processed radar data. Our research will lead to a robust understanding of convective mixed-phase processes and quantification of their influence on observed cross-environment and cross-lifetime variability, providing useful benchmarks for cloud process representation in computer models ranging from small-scale ones that resolve individual convective clouds through large-scale ones that simulate the entire earth system. Improved understanding of how environments modulate storm intensity and mixed-phase region properties will aid in the development of representations of convective clouds and their processes in these models. Quantifying the spectral content of cells' coherent structures provides critical information on typical timescales and temporal relationships to other structures, painting a complete picture of convective processes through cloud lifetimes. Our research introduces powerful machine learning tools with broad applicability to the climate and atmospheric science community. Lessons learned from detailed analyses of the unprecedented radar dataset will lead to concrete recommendations for future implementations of these specialized radar scanning strategies.

Kumjian, The Pennsylvania State University Co-Investigators: Romit Maulik, The Pennsylvania State University Unfunded Collaborators: Virendra Ghate, Argonne National Laboratory Deep convective clouds play crucial roles in our climate by contributing to Earth's energy budget, water cycle, and vertical transport of winds, heat, moisture, and aerosol particles. Thus, it is important to accurately represent them in computer models of all scales. However, the immense complexity of processes in these clouds coupled with a lack of robust observations within them impede understanding and produce significant uncertainties in the ways our models represent them. Detailed, direct observations are critically needed to improve our understanding of these processes and to provide guidance for representing these processes in models. Fortunately, the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) field campaign, which took place in Houston, Texas, provided such much-needed observational datasets tailored for convective cloud processes. For the first time, a radar deployed as part of this campaign operated in a special storm-tracking mode that allowed it to collect thousands of high-resolution scans of deep convective clouds. This novel dataset is paired with high-resolution measurements of the environment in the vicinity these clouds collected from frequent weather balloon launches and diverse surface and profiling instruments. We will use this unprecedented quantity and quality of information to elucidate the clouds\u2019 mixed-phase processes \u2013 i.e., those involving liquid and ice particles or hydrometeors \u2013 across cloud lifecycles and environments. By doing so, we will address the following science questions: What are the typical hydrometeor and wind structures of convective cloud mixed-phase regions? How are these structures related to the storm\u2019s intensity and parent environment? What are these structures' typical growth/decay pathways and timescales? Doing so will achieve the project's main objectives: Objective 1: Characterize the major radar signals in mixed-phase regions, quantify their relative importance (in terms of explaining the variance) across the entire dataset, and provide interpretations of the microphysical and kinematic processes they represent. Objective 2: Quantify how these major structures vary across environments sampled during the field campaign, and determine their correlation with radar-based measures of storm intensity. Objective 3: Quantify the frequency content associated with these structures, their growth rates, how their emergence is related to radar-based measures of storm intensity, and their timescales. The sheer volume and complexity of the novel radar dataset necessitates new tools and a \"big data\" analysis approach. To tackle this challenge, we have developed radar data preprocessing software that allows for extraction and recentering of isolated convective cloud \"snapshots.\" We will analyze these snapshots using high-performance machine learning methods, in which linear algebra techniques allow efficient coherent pattern extraction from large datasets, and analyses of cloud evolution. These tools will facilitate comparison of the clouds\u2019 coherent structures to individual scans to quantify when they emerge or disappear throughout the cloud\u2019s lifetime. We will utilize modal analyses techniques including proper orthogonal decomposition, dynamic mode decomposition, and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition on matrices constructed from the processed radar data. Our research will lead to a robust understanding of convective mixed-phase processes and quantification of their influence on observed cross-environment and cross-lifetime variability, providing useful benchmarks for cloud process representation in computer models ranging from small-scale ones that resolve individual convective clouds through large-scale ones that simulate the entire earth system. Improved understanding of how environments modulate storm intensity and mixed-phase region properties will aid in the development of representations of convective clouds and their processes in these models. Quantifying the spectral content of cells' coherent structures provides critical information on typical timescales and temporal relationships to other structures, painting a complete picture of convective processes through cloud lifetimes. Our research introduces powerful machine learning tools with broad applicability to the climate and atmospheric science community. Lessons learned from detailed analyses of the unprecedented radar dataset will lead to concrete recommendations for future implementations of these specialized radar scanning strategies. The cross-disciplinary nature of the proposed research and team serves as a bridge between two communities with complementary skills and expertise, fostering collaborations and new science."

We propose to establish M2dt, a center for research and education on multifaceted mathematical foundations of predictive digital twins (DTs) for complex systems. A DT is a computational model that evolves over time to persistently represent the structure, behavior, and context of a unique physical system or process. DTs are characterized by a dynamic and continuous two-way flow of information between the computational model and the physical system. Data streams from the physical system are assimilated into the computational model to reduce uncertainties and improve predictions, which in turn are used as a basis for controlling the physical system, optimizing data acquisition, and providing decision support. To support critical high-consequence decisions, the DT must be trustworthy through a combination of explainability, uncertainty quantification (UQ), and validation and verification. DTs are key to unlocking the full potential of decades of investment in computational modeling\u2014moving beyond forward simulation to underpin intelligent automation in complex systems by supporting data-driven decision making informed by dynamic system-specific analysis. Multifaceted mathematical challenges and opportunities. The tight, dynamic interplay between computational models and physical systems, the rapid time scales needed for decision making and control, the heterogeneity of data sources that must be assimilated, the coupled nature of target systems, and the need for robustness to data and model uncertainties to support high-consequence decisions\u2014these present frontier mathematical and computational challenges for DTs and place them at the forefront of applied math and computational science research today. M2dt will address these challenges via an integrated and multifaceted research program that unites the complementary perspectives of physics-based computational science (PDE solvers, data assimilation, reduced-order models (ROMs), optimal control, UQ) with statistical/data sciences (machine learning (ML), graphical models, dimensionality reduction, optimal experimental design, optimization) to advance the state of the art in these areas and at their interfaces. In particular, we will pursue: (1) new mathematical and statistical frameworks and computational algorithms, and new representations blending graphical and PDE models, to enable causal inference and dynamic decision making for complex systems; (2) new dimensionality reduction methods exploiting nonlinear manifolds; (3) new data-driven, ML-based, structure preserving ROMs and surrogates of high fidelity models that address high dimensional state and parameter spaces; (4) new algorithms to orchestrate the use of hierarchies of models in DTs, given constraints on latencies, bandwidth, response times, and data availability, on heterogeneous compute platforms from edge devices to exascale systems; and (5) new decomposition algorithms to tackle the challenges of data assimilation and optimal control for tightly coupled multiphysics problems. Target applications. The potential impacts of DTs are enormous and cut across every DOE mission area. Just a few examples of physical systems whose inference and control will be enabled by the mathematical research proposed here are: plasma fusion, carbon sequestration, combustion engines, transportation, climate, power grids, subsurface contaminants, and advanced materials and manufacturing. Beyond DOE mission problems, the DT framework extends broadly across numerous scientific, engineering, medical, financial, and societal systems. While our work will be widely applicable, we have chosen two application testbeds spanning the spectrum of decision time scales to both drive our work and demonstrate the power of DTs: (1) a materials science testbed involving a DT for real-time control of self-assembling thin films and (2) a climate science testbed focused on a DT for coupled ice shelf-ocean cavity systems. Team, education, and mentoring. We have marshaled a team of leading authorities in data assimilation, optimization, optimal control, UQ, ROMs, DTs, statistical learning, ML, high performance computing, and coupled multiphysics modeling. Beyond the mathematical research proposed here, M2dt team members will parlay their roles as educators, mentors, and community leaders to deliver an extensive program of mentoring and outreach."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales. The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions.

Target applications. The potential impacts of DTs are enormous and cut across every DOE mission area. Just a few examples of physical systems whose inference and control will be enabled by the mathematical research proposed here are: plasma fusion, carbon sequestration, combustion engines, transportation, climate, power grids, subsurface contaminants, and advanced materials and manufacturing. Beyond DOE mission problems, the DT framework extends broadly across numerous scientific, engineering, medical, financial, and societal systems. While our work will be widely applicable, we have chosen two application testbeds spanning the spectrum of decision time scales to both drive our work and demonstrate the power of DTs: (1) a materials science testbed involving a DT for real-time control of self-assembling thin films and (2) a climate science testbed focused on a DT for coupled ice shelf-ocean cavity systems. Team, education, and mentoring. We have marshaled a team of leading authorities in data assimilation, optimization, optimal control, UQ, ROMs, DTs, statistical learning, ML, high performance computing, and coupled multiphysics modeling.

          "public_abstract": "This project aims to advance MultiSector Dynamics (MSD) research and methods by enhancing and combining multi-disciplinary tools, analytic methods, and visualization platforms to explore the implications of influences, stressors, and risks for complex interconnected physical and socio-economic systems. An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually. It is home to many strong connections between land, water, energy, and transportation as well as subject to multiple extreme events (e.g. floods, droughts and heat waves) and other abrupt and gradual changes (e.g. related to economic and population growth, energy transitions, land use changes, demand changes, etc.), making it well-suited for MSD research. Using this geographic area to focus the research, we willpursue a broader goal of better understanding forces and patterns, stabilities and instabilities, foresight, and the resilience of co-evolving systems in the context of multiple and compounding human and environmental stressors. In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions.

We will utilize deep learning (DL) to improve plant trait parameterization for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) coupled to a next-generation dynamic vegetation model, the Functionally Assembled TErrestrial Simulator (FATES). The project seeks to understand (i) how soil, topography, and other environmental variables influence plant hydraulics, growth, and mortality parameters; (ii) relative importance and uncertainty sources of these parameters; and (iii) characteristics of plant hydraulic parameters, such as time-dependence and identifiability. Building on our previous and preliminary work, a major contribution of the research is a novel and highly efficient parameter learning framework for estimating environment-dependent and scale-dependent vegetation trait parameters with uncertainty estimations. This framework, saving four orders-of-magnitude of computational time, can be applied instantly on large scales, and has very competitive and potentially stronger optimization metrics than current optimization algorithms. It can be said that, instead of solving one inversion problem at a time, our framework will train a tool that solves this problem with higher efficient and more robust results. Additionally, this framework opens fresh pathways to address issues and ask new questions from a data-driven perspective. We will reduce uncertainty and improve physical significance of parameters by imposing novel constraints, such as information-transfer (parameters are roughly functions of plant types and environmental covariates) and covariation (exploiting observed inter-parameter relationships). At the same time, local heterogeneities in traits can be expressed, allowing us to understand the relative importance of stochasticity and environmental controls of plant traits. By interrogating the trained parameter learning model, we will reveal the linkages between topography, grid scale, soil, climate, and plant hydraulic traits, growth, and mortality parameters. We will also use time-dependent parameters as keys to identify deficiencies in model dynamics. This framework will usher in a new era for parameter determination for land surface models."

Data streams from the physical system are assimilated into the computational model to reduce uncertainties and improve predictions, which in turn are used as a basis for controlling the physical system, optimizing data acquisition, and providing decision support.

Target applications. The potential impacts of DTs are enormous and cut across every DOE mission area. Just a few examples of physical systems whose inference and control will be enabled by the mathematical research proposed here are: plasma fusion, carbon sequestration, combustion engines, transportation, climate, power grids, subsurface contaminants, and advanced materials and manufacturing. Beyond DOE mission problems, the DT framework extends broadly across numerous scientific, engineering, medical, financial, and societal systems. While our work will be widely applicable, we have chosen two application testbeds spanning the spectrum of decision time scales to both drive our work and demonstrate the power of DTs: (1) a materials science testbed involving a DT for real-time control of self-assembling thin films and (2) a climate science testbed focused on a DT for coupled ice shelf-ocean cavity systems.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions.

The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework.

When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size.

We will utilize deep learning (DL) to improve plant trait parameterization for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) coupled to a next-generation dynamic vegetation model, the Functionally Assembled TErrestrial Simulator (FATES). The project seeks to understand (i) how soil, topography, and other environmental variables influence plant hydraulics, growth, and mortality parameters; (ii) relative importance and uncertainty sources of these parameters; and (iii) characteristics of plant hydraulic parameters, such as time-dependence and identifiability. Building on our previous and preliminary work, a major contribution of the research is a novel and highly efficient parameter learning framework for estimating environment-dependent and scale-dependent vegetation trait parameters with uncertainty estimations. This framework, saving four orders-of-magnitude of computational time, can be applied instantly on large scales, and has very competitive and potentially stronger optimization metrics than current optimization algorithms. It can be said that, instead of solving one inversion problem at a time, our framework will train a tool that solves this problem with higher efficient and more robust results. Additionally, this framework opens fresh pathways to address issues and ask new questions from a data-driven perspective. We will reduce uncertainty and improve physical significance of parameters by imposing novel constraints, such as information-transfer (parameters are roughly functions of plant types and environmental covariates) and covariation (exploiting observed inter-parameter relationships). At the same time, local heterogeneities in traits can be expressed, allowing us to understand the relative importance of stochasticity and environmental controls of plant traits. By interrogating the trained parameter learning model, we will reveal the linkages between topography, grid scale, soil, climate, and plant hydraulic traits, growth, and mortality parameters. We will also use time-dependent parameters as keys to identify deficiencies in model dynamics. This framework will usher in a new era for parameter determination for land surface models."

We propose to establish M2dt, a center for research and education on multifaceted mathematical foundations of predictive digital twins (DTs) for complex systems. A DT is a computational model that evolves over time to persistently represent the structure, behavior, and context of a unique physical system or process. DTs are characterized by a dynamic and continuous two-way flow of information between the computational model and the physical system. Data streams from the physical system are assimilated into the computational model to reduce uncertainties and improve predictions, which in turn are used as a basis for controlling the physical system, optimizing data acquisition, and providing decision support. To support critical high-consequence decisions, the DT must be trustworthy through a combination of explainability, uncertainty quantification (UQ), and validation and verification. DTs are key to unlocking the full potential of decades of investment in computational modeling\u2014moving beyond forward simulation to underpin intelligent automation in complex systems by supporting data-driven decision making informed by dynamic system-specific analysis. Multifaceted mathematical challenges and opportunities. The tight, dynamic interplay between computational models and physical systems, the rapid time scales needed for decision making and control, the heterogeneity of data sources that must be assimilated, the coupled nature of target systems, and the need for robustness to data and model uncertainties to support high-consequence decisions\u2014these present frontier mathematical and computational challenges for DTs and place them at the forefront of applied math and computational science research today. M2dt will address these challenges via an integrated and multifaceted research program that unites the complementary perspectives of physics-based computational science (PDE solvers, data assimilation, reduced-order models (ROMs), optimal control, UQ) with statistical/data sciences (machine learning (ML), graphical models, dimensionality reduction, optimal experimental design, optimization) to advance the state of the art in these areas and at their interfaces. In particular, we will pursue: (1) new mathematical and statistical frameworks and computational algorithms, and new representations blending graphical and PDE models, to enable causal inference and dynamic decision making for complex systems; (2) new dimensionality reduction methods exploiting nonlinear manifolds; (3) new data-driven, ML-based, structure preserving ROMs and surrogates of high fidelity models that address high dimensional state and parameter spaces; (4) new algorithms to orchestrate the use of hierarchies of models in DTs, given constraints on latencies, bandwidth, response times, and data availability, on heterogeneous compute platforms from edge devices to exascale systems; and (5) new decomposition algorithms to tackle the challenges of data assimilation and optimal control for tightly coupled multiphysics problems. Target applications. The potential impacts of DTs are enormous and cut across every DOE mission area.

The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products",

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions.

We propose to establish M2dt, a center for research and education on multifaceted mathematical foundations of predictive digital twins (DTs) for complex systems. A DT is a computational model that evolves over time to persistently represent the structure, behavior, and context of a unique physical system or process. DTs are characterized by a dynamic and continuous two-way flow of information between the computational model and the physical system. Data streams from the physical system are assimilated into the computational model to reduce uncertainties and improve predictions, which in turn are used as a basis for controlling the physical system, optimizing data acquisition, and providing decision support.

Target applications. The potential impacts of DTs are enormous and cut across every DOE mission area. Just a few examples of physical systems whose inference and control will be enabled by the mathematical research proposed here are: plasma fusion, carbon sequestration, combustion engines, transportation, climate, power grids, subsurface contaminants, and advanced materials and manufacturing. Beyond DOE mission problems, the DT framework extends broadly across numerous scientific, engineering, medical, financial, and societal systems. While our work will be widely applicable, we have chosen two application testbeds spanning the spectrum of decision time scales to both drive our work and demonstrate the power of DTs: (1) a materials science testbed involving a DT for real-time control of self-assembling thin films and (2) a climate science testbed focused on a DT for coupled ice shelf-ocean cavity systems. Team, education, and mentoring. We have marshaled a team of leading authorities in data assimilation, optimization, optimal control, UQ, ROMs, DTs, statistical learning, ML, high performance computing, and coupled multiphysics modeling. Beyond the mathematical research proposed here, M2dt team members will parlay their roles as educators, mentors, and community leaders to deliver an extensive program of mentoring and outreach."

They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products",

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions. While the hybrid earthquake scenario generator will provide an essential capability for ensuring the resiliency and cost-effectiveness of future energy systems to earthquake risk, the framework that will be developed as part of this project will open transformative possibilities to regional-scale distributed infrastructure system resilience assessment and risk reduction more broadly. Since the machine learning algorithms will be agnostic to the earthquake source and wave propagation physics that lie under the hood, we envision the hybridized framework as a stepping stone to assessing resilience and risk associated with other hazards threatening energy systems, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and combinations thereof."

We propose to establish M2dt, a center for research and education on multifaceted mathematical foundations of predictive digital twins (DTs) for complex systems. A DT is a computational model that evolves over time to persistently represent the structure, behavior, and context of a unique physical system or process. DTs are characterized by a dynamic and continuous two-way flow of information between the computational model and the physical system. Data streams from the physical system are assimilated into the computational model to reduce uncertainties and improve predictions, which in turn are used as a basis for controlling the physical system, optimizing data acquisition, and providing decision support. To support critical high-consequence decisions, the DT must be trustworthy through a combination of explainability, uncertainty quantification (UQ), and validation and verification. DTs are key to unlocking the full potential of decades of investment in computational modeling\u2014moving beyond forward simulation to underpin intelligent automation in complex systems by supporting data-driven decision making informed by dynamic system-specific analysis. Multifaceted mathematical challenges and opportunities. The tight, dynamic interplay between computational models and physical systems, the rapid time scales needed for decision making and control, the heterogeneity of data sources that must be assimilated, the coupled nature of target systems, and the need for robustness to data and model uncertainties to support high-consequence decisions\u2014these present frontier mathematical and computational challenges for DTs and place them at the forefront of applied math and computational science research today. M2dt will address these challenges via an integrated and multifaceted research program that unites the complementary perspectives of physics-based computational science (PDE solvers, data assimilation, reduced-order models (ROMs), optimal control, UQ) with statistical/data sciences (machine learning (ML), graphical models, dimensionality reduction, optimal experimental design, optimization) to advance the state of the art in these areas and at their interfaces.

Target applications. The potential impacts of DTs are enormous and cut across every DOE mission area. Just a few examples of physical systems whose inference and control will be enabled by the mathematical research proposed here are: plasma fusion, carbon sequestration, combustion engines, transportation, climate, power grids, subsurface contaminants, and advanced materials and manufacturing. Beyond DOE mission problems, the DT framework extends broadly across numerous scientific, engineering, medical, financial, and societal systems. While our work will be widely applicable, we have chosen two application testbeds spanning the spectrum of decision time scales to both drive our work and demonstrate the power of DTs: (1) a materials science testbed involving a DT for real-time control of self-assembling thin films and (2) a climate science testbed focused on a DT for coupled ice shelf-ocean cavity systems. Team, education, and mentoring. We have marshaled a team of leading authorities in data assimilation, optimization, optimal control, UQ, ROMs, DTs, statistical learning, ML, high performance computing, and coupled multiphysics modeling. Beyond the mathematical research proposed here, M2dt team members will parlay their roles as educators, mentors, and community leaders to deliver an extensive program of mentoring and outreach."

To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions. While the hybrid earthquake scenario generator will provide an essential capability for ensuring the resiliency and cost-effectiveness of future energy systems to earthquake risk, the framework that will be developed as part of this project will open transformative possibilities to regional-scale distributed infrastructure system resilience assessment and risk reduction more broadly. Since the machine learning algorithms will be agnostic to the earthquake source and wave propagation physics that lie under the hood, we envision the hybridized framework as a stepping stone to assessing resilience and risk associated with other hazards threatening energy systems, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and combinations thereof."

          "public_abstract": "The advent of ultracold chemistry (T < 1 mK) has facilitated the exploration of bimolecular reactions in detail long sought after by chemists. Such studies are made possible by the exquisite control the experi- mentalist has over the states of molecules produced in this regime, owing to the coherent and state-selective optical process by which they are formed. The ability to completely specify the initial states of the reac- tants, when coupled with state-specific detection methods, allows for the complete mapping of state-to-state dynamics in these reactions. We have previously harnessed these capabilities to study the model KRb + KRb system to great effect, mapping the full product state distribution and determining that the reaction intermediate lives for sufficiently long times (>100 ns) to be probed and controlled optically. These studies have proven foundational to our understanding of chemistry in this regime, and the current proposal focuses on building upon this early work to establish a means to control the outcome of ultracold reactions. The focus of this work will be atom-molecule reactions, i.e. the Rb + KRb reaction, selected for their relative simplicity compared to molecule-molecule reactions while still displaying rich chemical dynamics. The facile manipulation of atomic states enables us to explore reactions where the reactants have a wide array of internal energies, spanning 10\u22124 to 104 cm\u2212\u00b9. Such studies will allow us to systematically explore the unimolecular dissociation reaction of the KRb2 collisional complex, arising from the endother- mic Rb + KRb reaction, as exit channels are opened or closed, dramatically changing its dissociation rate. Further, it may be possible to tune the energy of this complex through resonance with an exit channel using external fields, thereby allowing us to control the product distribution. Such work will be performed with state-to-state resolution of both the atomic and molecular products, made possible by the recent development of an optical Rydberg excitation apparatus in our instrument. This hardware further enables the study of highly-excited reactants, namely Rydberg Rb + KRb, which are of particular interest at these low temperatures as the collision energies are insufficient to directly ionize these atomic states, allowing for their interactions between ultracold partners to dominate. We will exploit this to explore interactions in the short range that well approximate ion-neutral reactions that can be selectively turned off by judicious choice of the molecular state.

The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA.

Cheng, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Co-Investigator) The proposed research will develop and deploy Quantum Digital Twins (QDT), hardware emulators that are individual digital clones of existing quantum devises. The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework. A key feature of our QDTs is the bi-directional interaction between virtual and physical siblings. In a calibration phase, a QDT\u2019s performance is monitored and improved in a cost-efficient way by optimal experimental design. When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products.

Our work has the potential to impact quantum approaches to solving scientific problems of interest to DOE. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to inform the design and training of variational algorithms more generally, thus, extending the applicability to the variational quantum eigensolver and electronic structure calculations. In addition, our work could assist in circumventing barren plateaus, where optimal AQC schedules are used to provide near-optimal initial conditions when training large variational algorithms. More broadly, our work can supply intuition into the potential utility of a particular quantum computing model based on the specifications of the computational problem. As a result, the need for extensive empirical benchmarking utilizing costly classical and quantum computational resources could be reduced."

This project studies how bright, attosecond pulses of soft-X-ray radiation from state-of-the-art light sources are reshaped in the interaction with quantum matter. Understanding this reshaping in the time, frequency, and spatial domains is important in several ways: (i) the reshaping can be a signature of the dynamics that took place during the light-matter interaction, and (ii) reshaping of light is crucial to the development, characterization and control of next-generation light sources. Our program addresses both aspects, in service of the BES AMOS goal of understanding quantum dynamics at the fastest time scales. We study atto- and femtosecond pulse reshaping using a versatile theoretical treatment that takes account of both the strong laser-matter interaction at the single-system level, by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) in some approximation, and, when appropriate, the propagation of the radiation in the non-linear medium, by solving the Maxwell wave equation using the TDSE-calculated time-dependent polarization as a source term.

Our work has the potential to impact quantum approaches to solving scientific problems of interest to DOE. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to inform the design and training of variational algorithms more generally, thus, extending the applicability to the variational quantum eigensolver and electronic structure calculations. In addition, our work could assist in circumventing barren plateaus, where optimal AQC schedules are used to provide near-optimal initial conditions when training large variational algorithms. More broadly, our work can supply intuition into the potential utility of a particular quantum computing model based on the specifications of the computational problem. As a result, the need for extensive empirical benchmarking utilizing costly classical and quantum computational resources could be reduced."

          "public_abstract": "The advent of ultracold chemistry (T < 1 mK) has facilitated the exploration of bimolecular reactions in detail long sought after by chemists. Such studies are made possible by the exquisite control the experi- mentalist has over the states of molecules produced in this regime, owing to the coherent and state-selective optical process by which they are formed. The ability to completely specify the initial states of the reac- tants, when coupled with state-specific detection methods, allows for the complete mapping of state-to-state dynamics in these reactions. We have previously harnessed these capabilities to study the model KRb + KRb system to great effect, mapping the full product state distribution and determining that the reaction intermediate lives for sufficiently long times (>100 ns) to be probed and controlled optically. These studies have proven foundational to our understanding of chemistry in this regime, and the current proposal focuses on building upon this early work to establish a means to control the outcome of ultracold reactions. The focus of this work will be atom-molecule reactions, i.e. the Rb + KRb reaction, selected for their relative simplicity compared to molecule-molecule reactions while still displaying rich chemical dynamics. The facile manipulation of atomic states enables us to explore reactions where the reactants have a wide array of internal energies, spanning 10\u22124 to 104 cm\u2212\u00b9. Such studies will allow us to systematically explore the unimolecular dissociation reaction of the KRb2 collisional complex, arising from the endother- mic Rb + KRb reaction, as exit channels are opened or closed, dramatically changing its dissociation rate. Further, it may be possible to tune the energy of this complex through resonance with an exit channel using external fields, thereby allowing us to control the product distribution. Such work will be performed with state-to-state resolution of both the atomic and molecular products, made possible by the recent development of an optical Rydberg excitation apparatus in our instrument. This hardware further enables the study of highly-excited reactants, namely Rydberg Rb + KRb, which are of particular interest at these low temperatures as the collision energies are insufficient to directly ionize these atomic states, allowing for their interactions between ultracold partners to dominate. We will exploit this to explore interactions in the short range that well approximate ion-neutral reactions that can be selectively turned off by judicious choice of the molecular state. In the intermediate range, these interactions result in very weakly bound species, with binding energy \u223c 10\u22124 cm\u2212\u00b9, which have implications in low-energy electron attachment.

          "public_abstract": "The advent of ultracold chemistry (T < 1 mK) has facilitated the exploration of bimolecular reactions in detail long sought after by chemists. Such studies are made possible by the exquisite control the experi- mentalist has over the states of molecules produced in this regime, owing to the coherent and state-selective optical process by which they are formed. The ability to completely specify the initial states of the reac- tants, when coupled with state-specific detection methods, allows for the complete mapping of state-to-state dynamics in these reactions. We have previously harnessed these capabilities to study the model KRb + KRb system to great effect, mapping the full product state distribution and determining that the reaction intermediate lives for sufficiently long times (>100 ns) to be probed and controlled optically. These studies have proven foundational to our understanding of chemistry in this regime, and the current proposal focuses on building upon this early work to establish a means to control the outcome of ultracold reactions. The focus of this work will be atom-molecule reactions, i.e. the Rb + KRb reaction, selected for their relative simplicity compared to molecule-molecule reactions while still displaying rich chemical dynamics. The facile manipulation of atomic states enables us to explore reactions where the reactants have a wide array of internal energies, spanning 10\u22124 to 104 cm\u2212\u00b9. Such studies will allow us to systematically explore the unimolecular dissociation reaction of the KRb2 collisional complex, arising from the endother- mic Rb + KRb reaction, as exit channels are opened or closed, dramatically changing its dissociation rate. Further, it may be possible to tune the energy of this complex through resonance with an exit channel using external fields, thereby allowing us to control the product distribution. Such work will be performed with state-to-state resolution of both the atomic and molecular products, made possible by the recent development of an optical Rydberg excitation apparatus in our instrument. This hardware further enables the study of highly-excited reactants, namely Rydberg Rb + KRb, which are of particular interest at these low temperatures as the collision energies are insufficient to directly ionize these atomic states, allowing for their interactions between ultracold partners to dominate. We will exploit this to explore interactions in the short range that well approximate ion-neutral reactions that can be selectively turned off by judicious choice of the molecular state. In the intermediate range, these interactions result in very weakly bound species, with binding energy \u223c 10\u22124 cm\u2212\u00b9, which have implications in low-energy electron attachment.

Indeed, it is also well established that QIS may have the opportunity to transform industries, create jobs, and yield great benefits for the world\u2019s population. Transferring information between stationary (spin) qubits and propagating (photonic) qubits is a critical step in realizing these transformative technologies. Quantum transduction is the coherent exchange of information between quantum systems, such as photons and electron spins, and is essential for establishing coherent communications between quantum processing nodes.

Transferring information between stationary (spin) qubits and propagating (photonic) qubits is a critical step in realizing these transformative technologies. Quantum transduction is the coherent exchange of information between quantum systems, such as photons and electron spins, and is essential for establishing coherent communications between quantum processing nodes.

          "public_abstract": "Recent empirical demonstrations pointing toward quantum advantage have fueled excitement and growth in the field. However, many high-profile demonstrations suggesting quantum advantage have prompted improvements in classical algorithm design (e.g., tensor-network methods) and enlist additional classical resources (e.g., supercomputing) with surprising progress in closing quantum-advantage gaps. While quantum-inspired classical improvements are a healthy benefit of quantum-computing research, to ultimately realize quantum utility it is important to systematically identify, understand, and publicize sources of quantum advantage that are unlikely to be diminished as classical computing progresses. A demonstration of quantum utility may conjure the image of a plot indicating that a quantum computer performs better (with respect to some metric) than the best-known classical counterparts. This basic concept of quantum utility raises natural questions. Soundness: What evidence do we have that a quantum computer will continue to be the best way to solve this problem as input instances grow larger or more complex? Cost-effectiveness: Will a quantum computer be the most cost-effective way to solve the problem? Resource efficiency: Will some other resource considerations, such as energy to solution, rule out practical adoption of the quantum computing solution? While well-conceived notions of quantum utility have been suggested, none, to our knowledge, simultaneously take all of the above into account. Our goal is to identify sources of sustainable quantum utility, those that are sound, cost effective, and resource efficient. We believe that sustainable quantum utility is the best candidate for realizing the promise of quantum computing. We aim to discover examples of sustainable quantum utility through three guiding perspectives: (1) sustainable quantum utility should be backed by strong evidence or proof of asymptotic advantage \u2014 in other words, there should be some feature of quantum mechanics that continues to provide an advantage in a reasonably predictable manner as problem instances grow in size or complexity, (2) an array of resources beyond execution time should be considered to ensure that quantum advantages are indeed practical and that we are not overlooking unconventional quantum advantages, and (3) we should focus on developing quantum advantages for fundamental problems in broad domains such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning, that can be tailored to yield sustainable quantum utility for new and existing applications. While a major barrier to sustainable quantum utility is the current lack of mature, scalable, and error-resilient quantum computing hardware, sustainable quantum utility is also hampered by equally formidable fundamental algorithmic challenges. We address such algorithmic challenges by (1) developing unconventional quantum computing models, algorithms, and advantages that consider other computational resource bottlenecks, including running time, space/memory, solution accuracy, energy expenditure, and communication costs; (2) targeting basic scientific problems that are critical components in broad applications, such as simulating quantum systems and solving differential equations, linear systems, and continuous and discrete optimization problems; and (3) engaging in the full-stack-aware design of quantum algorithms that adjust computing-stack components to pave the way to unconventional demonstrations of sustainable quantum utility."

The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC.

We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures. We plan to use selective poisons and site blockers to help identify and quantify active sites and design doping (P, B, O, halogen) strategies to enhance the CNx activity/selectivity by changing the electronic structure around the active sites. We also plan to integrate a range of new in situ/operando experimental characterization techniques, consisting of near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), IR and Raman spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. To enable operando characterization, we will use custom built electrochemical cells designed in our labs to explore the surface restructuring under operating conditions. DFT will be used to assist in interpreting the spectroscopy by predicting XPS binding energy shifts along with adsorbate vibrational spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic activity and selectivity testing combined with DFT predictions of activity for specific CNx models will establish refined structure-activity relationships. Our previous work on CNx materials as electrocatalysts have shown promising activity for many low-temperature applications in acidic media, such as ORR catalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), as OER catalysts in regenerative fuel cells, and as oxygen depolarized cathodes in hydrochloric acid or bromic acid electrolysis.

          "public_abstract": "Fundamental Studies of the Multifunctional Electrocatalysis on Heteroatom-doped Carbon (CNx) Catalysts Umit S. Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions. Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures. We plan to use selective poisons and site blockers to help identify and quantify active sites and design doping (P, B, O, halogen) strategies to enhance the CNx activity/selectivity by changing the electronic structure around the active sites. We also plan to integrate a range of new in situ/operando experimental characterization techniques, consisting of near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), IR and Raman spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. To enable operando characterization, we will use custom built electrochemical cells designed in our labs to explore the surface restructuring under operating conditions. DFT will be used to assist in interpreting the spectroscopy by predicting XPS binding energy shifts along with adsorbate vibrational spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic activity and selectivity testing combined with DFT predictions of activity for specific CNx models will establish refined structure-activity relationships.

We propose to use nanoelectrochemical techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to carry out quantitative, spatially resolved photoelectrochemical experiments aimed at measuring photo(electro)catalytic activity and characterizing heterogeneity of a wide range of semiconductor nanomaterials. We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

          "public_abstract": "An Integrated Electrochemical Approach to the Precision Synthesis of Sustainable Catalyst Materials Michelle L. Personick, University of Virginia (Principal Investigator) Platinum group elements (PGE) such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are key components in many energy storage technologies, including fuel cells and the sustainable production of liquid fuels using renewable electricity. However, the relative scarcity of these elements creates problems for scale up and implementation of sustainable energy technologies due to the high prices of these elements and uncertainty in their sourcing. This instability in the supply chain can also cause problems for national security. Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE. This proposal addresses a significant fundamental knowledge gap in the synthesis of non-PGE nanoparticles with well-defined shapes. Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications. The integrated electrochemical approach to be employed in this work introduces unique flexibility in synthetic design that will enable both enhanced fundamental insight into non-PGE metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms and the development of innovative synthesis approaches that move beyond the classic conditions employed in the field. Using real-time electrochemical measurements, our integrated approach allows us to define desired parameters for the selection of novel reaction conditions for nanoparticle synthesis, thus breaking the boundaries of literature precedent. In addition, we will probe the mechanistic roles of components such as surfactants and shape-directing agents in ways that are not possible using colloidal synthesis development approaches, providing a more complete understanding of the critically important role of these additives in colloidal growth. Finally, our electrochemical synthesis makes it possible to precisely tune the reaction conditions at each step of nanoparticle growth while also providing real-time insight into the impact of changing reaction conditions. It is thus a powerful tool for the precision design and implementation of nanoparticle syntheses that control the dynamics of reaction chemistry in a way that is well outside the limits of what is possible with existing methods. Coupled with these efforts, the successful development of methods for synthesizing nanoparticles of non-PGE with tailored surface facets\u2014including high-energy stepped surfaces\u2014will also provide a platform for a reduction in the use of PGE and noble metals without necessarily needing to replace them completely. This is an important step in moving toward materials sustainability and will be critical in situations where suitable alternatives to PGE are prohibitively difficult to identify. By epitaxially depositing a monolayer or thin multilayer of a PGE onto shaped non-PGE nanoparticles, the required arrangement of PGE atoms for a particular catalytic transformation can be achieved and stabilized while reducing the amount of the PGE required by orders of magnitude."

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions.

In a research environment where diversity is valued, equity is ingrained, and inclusion is integral, the center of Atomic Level Compositional Complexity for Electrocatalysis, Atomic -C2E, will integrate fundamental electrochemistry, ab initio quantum chemical and multi-scale simulations, and materials chemistry to develop a mechanistic understanding of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and the limiting step/s during water electrolysis in O2 evolution reaction (OER). Acquiring this knowledge will directly support the goals of the Hydrogen and Carbon Negative DOE Energy Earthshots. The elucidated fundamental insights will address technological bottlenecks challenging current electrocatalysts, such as high cost, poor stability, limited efficiency and/or selectivity of value-added products. Three interconnected thrusts will be pursued with a focus on achieving an atomic-level understanding. The thrusts\u2019 aims are to 1) Elucidate the effects of high compositional heterogeneity in electrocatalytically active surfaces, specifically high entropy oxides for OER in acidic environments. This thrust will investigate how strong compositional heterogeneity can be used to promote robust electrocatalytically active surfaces; 2) Correlate the compositional and structural rigor and tunability with CO2RR electrocatalytic activity and selectivity, i.e., the relative kinetics and proximity effects in atomically precise nanoclusters. Copper and gold will be the primary metals of interest to boost the production efficiency and selectivity of value-added products; 3) Develop and apply transferable multiscale computational models with experimental feedback, and to aid and guide experiments transcending specific material types. Atomic-C2E is led by Georgia State University (GSU), a Predominantly Black and Hispanic Serving Institution in downtown Atlanta. GSU is within about 2.5-hour drive to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), enabling effective and efficient outreach to underrepresented workforces and hands-on access to state-of-the-art facilities as elaborated in our Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER) Plan.

We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions. Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures.

Personick, University of Virginia (Principal Investigator) Platinum group elements (PGE) such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are key components in many energy storage technologies, including fuel cells and the sustainable production of liquid fuels using renewable electricity. However, the relative scarcity of these elements creates problems for scale up and implementation of sustainable energy technologies due to the high prices of these elements and uncertainty in their sourcing. This instability in the supply chain can also cause problems for national security. Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE. This proposal addresses a significant fundamental knowledge gap in the synthesis of non-PGE nanoparticles with well-defined shapes. Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications. The integrated electrochemical approach to be employed in this work introduces unique flexibility in synthetic design that will enable both enhanced fundamental insight into non-PGE metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms and the development of innovative synthesis approaches that move beyond the classic conditions employed in the field. Using real-time electrochemical measurements, our integrated approach allows us to define desired parameters for the selection of novel reaction conditions for nanoparticle synthesis, thus breaking the boundaries of literature precedent. In addition, we will probe the mechanistic roles of components such as surfactants and shape-directing agents in ways that are not possible using colloidal synthesis development approaches, providing a more complete understanding of the critically important role of these additives in colloidal growth. Finally, our electrochemical synthesis makes it possible to precisely tune the reaction conditions at each step of nanoparticle growth while also providing real-time insight into the impact of changing reaction conditions.

Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE. This proposal addresses a significant fundamental knowledge gap in the synthesis of non-PGE nanoparticles with well-defined shapes. Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications. The integrated electrochemical approach to be employed in this work introduces unique flexibility in synthetic design that will enable both enhanced fundamental insight into non-PGE metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms and the development of innovative synthesis approaches that move beyond the classic conditions employed in the field. Using real-time electrochemical measurements, our integrated approach allows us to define desired parameters for the selection of novel reaction conditions for nanoparticle synthesis, thus breaking the boundaries of literature precedent. In addition, we will probe the mechanistic roles of components such as surfactants and shape-directing agents in ways that are not possible using colloidal synthesis development approaches, providing a more complete understanding of the critically important role of these additives in colloidal growth. Finally, our electrochemical synthesis makes it possible to precisely tune the reaction conditions at each step of nanoparticle growth while also providing real-time insight into the impact of changing reaction conditions. It is thus a powerful tool for the precision design and implementation of nanoparticle syntheses that control the dynamics of reaction chemistry in a way that is well outside the limits of what is possible with existing methods. Coupled with these efforts, the successful development of methods for synthesizing nanoparticles of non-PGE with tailored surface facets\u2014including high-energy stepped surfaces\u2014will also provide a platform for a reduction in the use of PGE and noble metals without necessarily needing to replace them completely. This is an important step in moving toward materials sustainability and will be critical in situations where suitable alternatives to PGE are prohibitively difficult to identify. By epitaxially depositing a monolayer or thin multilayer of a PGE onto shaped non-PGE nanoparticles, the required arrangement of PGE atoms for a particular catalytic transformation can be achieved and stabilized while reducing the amount of the PGE required by orders of magnitude."

By systematically varying electrolyte composition and concentration, the project seeks to understand and control the solvation structures of lithium ions. These solvation structures\u2014how lithium ions are stabilized by surrounding molecules\u2014are critical to how the electrolyte interacts with the cathode surface. Insights into these interactions will inform the rational design of next-generation electrolytes that minimize transition metal loss, enhancing battery stability and longevity. The research will employ a combination of advanced characterization techniques, including X-ray scattering, X-ray fluorescence microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. These tools will be used to investigate the atomic-level changes at the electrolyte-cathode interface, as well as map the distribution of transition metals within the battery. Understanding these dynamics will be crucial for developing electrolytes that effectively inhibit transition metal dissolution during battery operation. The collaboration between Northern Illinois University and Argonne National Laboratory combines expertise in chemistry and materials science with state-of-the-art experimental resources. This partnership will enable a comprehensive investigation of how electrolyte formulations impact battery performance, contributing to the broader goal of advancing energy storage technologies. By addressing one of the critical challenges in lithium-ion batteries, this research will help improve the performance and lifespan of energy storage systems used in electric vehicles and renewable energy applications. The outcomes will have significant implications for the development of more sustainable and efficient batteries, aligning with national priorities to reduce carbon emissions and promote energy independence. Additionally, our scientific training and outcome will be integrated into educational programs to promote STEM education and raise public awareness about energy storage."

Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions.

A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

On the other hand, over the past decade or so, flash sintering (FS) emerges as a relatively new sintering technique that can achieve rapid densification of ceramic materials, especially oxides (e.g., yttria-stabilized zirconia or YSZ), within ~1-2 minutes or even a few seconds. The research objective of this proposal is toinvestigate the fundamental mechanism for flash sintering of highly conductive HTC materials and reveal the interrelationships between those materials\u2019 microstructure, defect and surface characteristics, transport properties, and their behaviors in flash sintering. To achieve this objective, technical approaches combining both experiments and theoretical calculations will be adopted. In particular, the detailed flash sintering behavior for highly conductive HTC materials (e.g., ZrN and ZrB2) will be studied including revealing the influence of processing parameters such as polarity, external pressure, sample preheating, starting relative density, and sintering aids. The samples\u2019 microstructure, local composition, point defects, surface characteristics, as well as electrical properties at different stages in flash sintering including incubation at the beginning, the transient or the flash, and the subsequent steady-state will be studied using different bulk and surface characterization techniques. In situ synchrotron study will be used to investigate the changes in HTC materials in real time during flash sintering, while their fundamental transport properties will be studied using techniques such as stable isotope-labelled diffusion-couple experiments. For theoretical calculation, finite element modeling will be used for understanding the impacts of porosity/contact area and less conductive surface shell for the powder compacts at different stages of flash sintering, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be used to reveal point defects generation and evolution and establish the relationships between defects characteristics and the electrical/diffusion characteristics displayed in the flash sintering process.

          "chunk_text": "Scientists are developing a method to efficiently produce hydrogen fuel from water using special photocatalyst materials that harness sunlight. Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design.

          "public_abstract": "Scientists are developing a method to efficiently produce hydrogen fuel from water using special photocatalyst materials that harness sunlight. Recently, they have added tiny metal nanoparticles to these materials to enhance efficiency. However, researchers disagree on how these metal nanoparticles aid the process. Some argue it results from significantly increased heating in confined spaces, while others believe it is due to very energetic carriers. This debate persists because characterizing the effect of local heating is challenging. This project aims to resolve this mystery by developing advanced imaging techniques to simultaneously measure thermal energy and gas (hydrogen and oxygen) production on a very small scale (billionths of a meter) with a controlled plasmonic nanoparticle array. By studying how tiny metal particles generate and share heat, this project will solve a key mystery: do these materials produce more hydrogen because they get hot, or because they create special high-energy particles? Understanding this will help us make better materials for turning sunlight into clean hydrogen fuel. A gold-titanium material system will be used for water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell, and the nanoparticle array will be created using electron-beam lithography. A simultaneous temperature and gas detection technique will be developed using highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. The imaging technique\u2019s sensitivity will be enhanced through microscope and metamaterial design. This technique will be complemented with ultrafast spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or a gas analyzer, and computer simulation.

The project aligns well with DOE Basic Energy Science priorities and will leverage the existing capabilities at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC) and the state-of-the-art facilities at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), preparing the project team thoroughly for this research. This collaboration holds great potential for new discoveries in how light interacts with materials to produce chemical reactions like hydrogen production. The project will foster a constructive partnership between TAMU-CC and SNL, aiding TAMU-CC, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) in the Coastal Bend region of South Texas, in expanding its research capabilities in fundamental science. Students, a post-graduate researcher, and the lead scientist will benefit from access to cutting-edge equipment and the opportunity to exchange ideas with experts in the field."

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions.

We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces. A new concept of voltage-driven molecular photoelectrocatalysis will be explored in which a molecular catalyst is directly (i.e., without a spacer) attached to the electrode surface, and the applied potential contributes to the driving force for the catalytic reaction. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of charge-transfer processes in nanostructured photoelectrocatalytic systems, which is essential for the progress in solar energy conversion, fuel generation, and energy-efficient synthesis. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new methodology for spatially resolved, quantitative studies of HER and OER processes at single semiconductor microcrystals; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities and active sites on 2D photo(electro)catalytic surfaces; and (3) new experimental approaches to the development and characterization of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. The anticipated results will impact the important BES technologies, including the photo(electro)catalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

Such materials should exhibit strong visible light absorption and long-lived charge separation with the capacity for charge transport (i.e. photoconductivity) while also affording a high density of accessible catalytic sites \u2014 a difficult combination of properties to implement in traditional catalytic systems. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of porous solid-state materials composed of metal ions or clusters connected through organic/organometallic linkers, are emerging alternatives for meeting these design targets. MOFs naturally incorporate light-responsive components that provide charge transfer and transport channels while simultaneously offering unique reaction environments with high densities of catalytic sites that are tunable through both framework design and post-synthetic modification. Despite a recent flurry of MOF photocatalyst demonstrations, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding their underlying photophysics and associated catalytic reaction mechanisms that impede rational optimization. This research is therefore geared toward a fundamental understanding of both the photophysical implications of MOF material modifications and how these modifications can strategically promote efficient photo(electro)catalysis. Optical transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy techniques, as a set of laser-based pump-probe methods used to gain information on excited state electronic structure and dynamics, are employed to monitor the photophysics and photoconductivity of these MOF systems as a continuous feedback loop to material design. Characterization of photocatalytic performance involves sustainability-minded benchmark reactions, such as CO2 reduction. NREL\u2019s longstanding expertise in applying these tools to problems involving photoinduced electron transfer and subsequent catalytic processes is intended to closely integrate with efforts at Rutgers-Newark on the materials-driven aspects of the project.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of porous solid-state materials composed of metal ions or clusters connected through organic/organometallic linkers, are emerging alternatives for meeting these design targets. MOFs naturally incorporate light-responsive components that provide charge transfer and transport channels while simultaneously offering unique reaction environments with high densities of catalytic sites that are tunable through both framework design and post-synthetic modification. Despite a recent flurry of MOF photocatalyst demonstrations, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding their underlying photophysics and associated catalytic reaction mechanisms that impede rational optimization. This research is therefore geared toward a fundamental understanding of both the photophysical implications of MOF material modifications and how these modifications can strategically promote efficient photo(electro)catalysis. Optical transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy techniques, as a set of laser-based pump-probe methods used to gain information on excited state electronic structure and dynamics, are employed to monitor the photophysics and photoconductivity of these MOF systems as a continuous feedback loop to material design. Characterization of photocatalytic performance involves sustainability-minded benchmark reactions, such as CO2 reduction. NREL\u2019s longstanding expertise in applying these tools to problems involving photoinduced electron transfer and subsequent catalytic processes is intended to closely integrate with efforts at Rutgers-Newark on the materials-driven aspects of the project.

In particular, the discovery that titanium oxide (TiO2) photocatalyzes the dissociation of water has triggered broad interest and intensive studies of water adsorption on TiO2 over decades. However, there is still limited information on the interfaces of TiO2 with liquid water and aqueous solutions, which are the relevant systems in most practical applications. The main goal of this project is to obtain a comprehensive picture of the surfaces and aqueous interfaces of TiO2 through first principles-based simulations, as this understanding can also help improve the ability to control their properties and those of other oxide interfaces as well. Specific systems/processes to be investigated in this renewal project include: the aqueous interface of amorphous TiO2, a widely used coating material in biomedical engineering and electrochemistry; carboxylic acid adsorption on TiO2 surfaces from dilute solution, one of the most common processes used for the functionalization of TiO2 and other metal oxide surfaces; the hydration structure of iridium oxide, which is widely considered as the current state-of-the-art anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction; and electron transfer across the aqueous interfaces of wide band gap oxides, a process affecting the production of H2 in water radiolysis. Our approach is based on quantum mechanical simulations combined with enhanced sampling and machine learning techniques, which allow us to model systems and phenomena spanning a wide range of size and time scales through accurate yet computationally efficient interatomic potentials based on deep neural networks."

The photocatalytic activity is known to be highly heterogeneous both in an ensemble of nanomaterials and within a single particle. Despite significant research activity, the understanding of photocatalytic heterogeneity remains incomplete. We propose to use nanoelectrochemical techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to carry out quantitative, spatially resolved photoelectrochemical experiments aimed at measuring photo(electro)catalytic activity and characterizing heterogeneity of a wide range of semiconductor nanomaterials. We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis. Photo-SECM will be used to map active sites on heterogeneous photo(electro)catalytic surfaces.

Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures. We plan to use selective poisons and site blockers to help identify and quantify active sites and design doping (P, B, O, halogen) strategies to enhance the CNx activity/selectivity by changing the electronic structure around the active sites. We also plan to integrate a range of new in situ/operando experimental characterization techniques, consisting of near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), IR and Raman spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. To enable operando characterization, we will use custom built electrochemical cells designed in our labs to explore the surface restructuring under operating conditions. DFT will be used to assist in interpreting the spectroscopy by predicting XPS binding energy shifts along with adsorbate vibrational spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic activity and selectivity testing combined with DFT predictions of activity for specific CNx models will establish refined structure-activity relationships. Our previous work on CNx materials as electrocatalysts have shown promising activity for many low-temperature applications in acidic media, such as ORR catalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), as OER catalysts in regenerative fuel cells, and as oxygen depolarized cathodes in hydrochloric acid or bromic acid electrolysis. Although CNx materials as electrocatalysts have been studied for some time, there are widely differing views on the active sites and the mechanistic steps in ORR and OER. And to the best of our knowledge, other than our preliminary work, there are no reports on using CNx for BER. Any electrocatalytic system that can have multi-functional characteristics is of great practical interest. The relevance to the DOE-BES mission lies in the need to acquire a fundamental understanding of the catalytic and electrocatalytic phenomena involved in oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and halide evolution reactions. While the questions to be addressed in the study and the approaches to be taken to answer them are fundamental, the results will have far-reaching implications for the energy future.",

The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions. Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures. We plan to use selective poisons and site blockers to help identify and quantify active sites and design doping (P, B, O, halogen) strategies to enhance the CNx activity/selectivity by changing the electronic structure around the active sites. We also plan to integrate a range of new in situ/operando experimental characterization techniques, consisting of near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), IR and Raman spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. To enable operando characterization, we will use custom built electrochemical cells designed in our labs to explore the surface restructuring under operating conditions. DFT will be used to assist in interpreting the spectroscopy by predicting XPS binding energy shifts along with adsorbate vibrational spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic activity and selectivity testing combined with DFT predictions of activity for specific CNx models will establish refined structure-activity relationships. Our previous work on CNx materials as electrocatalysts have shown promising activity for many low-temperature applications in acidic media, such as ORR catalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), as OER catalysts in regenerative fuel cells, and as oxygen depolarized cathodes in hydrochloric acid or bromic acid electrolysis. Although CNx materials as electrocatalysts have been studied for some time, there are widely differing views on the active sites and the mechanistic steps in ORR and OER. And to the best of our knowledge, other than our preliminary work, there are no reports on using CNx for BER. Any electrocatalytic system that can have multi-functional characteristics is of great practical interest. The relevance to the DOE-BES mission lies in the need to acquire a fundamental understanding of the catalytic and electrocatalytic phenomena involved in oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and halide evolution reactions. While the questions to be addressed in the study and the approaches to be taken to answer them are fundamental, the results will have far-reaching implications for the energy future."

          "public_abstract": "An Integrated Electrochemical Approach to the Precision Synthesis of Sustainable Catalyst Materials Michelle L. Personick, University of Virginia (Principal Investigator) Platinum group elements (PGE) such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are key components in many energy storage technologies, including fuel cells and the sustainable production of liquid fuels using renewable electricity. However, the relative scarcity of these elements creates problems for scale up and implementation of sustainable energy technologies due to the high prices of these elements and uncertainty in their sourcing. This instability in the supply chain can also cause problems for national security. Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE. This proposal addresses a significant fundamental knowledge gap in the synthesis of non-PGE nanoparticles with well-defined shapes. Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications. The integrated electrochemical approach to be employed in this work introduces unique flexibility in synthetic design that will enable both enhanced fundamental insight into non-PGE metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms and the development of innovative synthesis approaches that move beyond the classic conditions employed in the field. Using real-time electrochemical measurements, our integrated approach allows us to define desired parameters for the selection of novel reaction conditions for nanoparticle synthesis, thus breaking the boundaries of literature precedent. In addition, we will probe the mechanistic roles of components such as surfactants and shape-directing agents in ways that are not possible using colloidal synthesis development approaches, providing a more complete understanding of the critically important role of these additives in colloidal growth. Finally, our electrochemical synthesis makes it possible to precisely tune the reaction conditions at each step of nanoparticle growth while also providing real-time insight into the impact of changing reaction conditions. It is thus a powerful tool for the precision design and implementation of nanoparticle syntheses that control the dynamics of reaction chemistry in a way that is well outside the limits of what is possible with existing methods.

Working collaboratively, this project seeks to increase the number of historically underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields while broadening the understanding of solar driven chemical reactions. The project will strengthen the research and scientific opportunities at the three MSIs in collaboration with ANL and provide 12 students annually opportunities to engage in high-impact research focused on questions surrounding artificial and biohybrid photosynthesis. Through a year-round training program, weekly group meetings, and an annual week-long full group meeting at ANL, participants will be provided with ample networking opportunities, culturally responsive mentoring, and professional development. By engaging students in a collaborative research project and culturally responsive mentoring, faculty will work to improve the sociocultural environment and remove obstacles for the advancement of a diverse workforce in the photochemical sciences. This project builds on complementary techniques to understand and improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for solar fuel production. Nickel and cobalt molecular catalysts offer a promising opportunity for the development of new materials for solar fuel production as they are inexpensive, readily synthesized, and can be chemically modified to tune their properties. Computational modeling techniques will be utilized to understand the effect of structural changes on the catalysts. These results will aid in the design of improved biohybrid systems. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy will be utilized to characterize the charge-transfer events and electronic structure of the transition metal complexes and the biohybrid complexes. It is anticipated that the dual approach of an immersive inter-institutional research experience and culturally responsive mentoring as a means of effecting systemic change to support a diverse group of participants will lead to higher retention and persistence of a more diverse workforce.

The photocatalytic activity is known to be highly heterogeneous both in an ensemble of nanomaterials and within a single particle. Despite significant research activity, the understanding of photocatalytic heterogeneity remains incomplete. We propose to use nanoelectrochemical techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to carry out quantitative, spatially resolved photoelectrochemical experiments aimed at measuring photo(electro)catalytic activity and characterizing heterogeneity of a wide range of semiconductor nanomaterials. We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of porous solid-state materials composed of metal ions or clusters connected through organic/organometallic linkers, are emerging alternatives for meeting these design targets. MOFs naturally incorporate light-responsive components that provide charge transfer and transport channels while simultaneously offering unique reaction environments with high densities of catalytic sites that are tunable through both framework design and post-synthetic modification. Despite a recent flurry of MOF photocatalyst demonstrations, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding their underlying photophysics and associated catalytic reaction mechanisms that impede rational optimization. This research is therefore geared toward a fundamental understanding of both the photophysical implications of MOF material modifications and how these modifications can strategically promote efficient photo(electro)catalysis. Optical transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy techniques, as a set of laser-based pump-probe methods used to gain information on excited state electronic structure and dynamics, are employed to monitor the photophysics and photoconductivity of these MOF systems as a continuous feedback loop to material design. Characterization of photocatalytic performance involves sustainability-minded benchmark reactions, such as CO2 reduction. NREL\u2019s longstanding expertise in applying these tools to problems involving photoinduced electron transfer and subsequent catalytic processes is intended to closely integrate with efforts at Rutgers-Newark on the materials-driven aspects of the project. Within the framework of the DOE-FAIR program, this mutually beneficial collaborative project involves extensive graduate student training on advanced spectroscopic and analytical tools and therefore is building crucial research capacity at Rutgers-Newark, a non-R1, minority serving (MSI) and emerging research institution (ERI)."

          "public_abstract": "Next generation photoconductive materials and photocatalysts are needed to sustainably support current and growing U.S. and global energy demands. This research project explores molecular engineering strategies for realizing new functional materials and discovering novel mechanisms for photo(electro)catalysis, particularly for solar fuels generation. Such materials should exhibit strong visible light absorption and long-lived charge separation with the capacity for charge transport (i.e. photoconductivity) while also affording a high density of accessible catalytic sites \u2014 a difficult combination of properties to implement in traditional catalytic systems. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of porous solid-state materials composed of metal ions or clusters connected through organic/organometallic linkers, are emerging alternatives for meeting these design targets. MOFs naturally incorporate light-responsive components that provide charge transfer and transport channels while simultaneously offering unique reaction environments with high densities of catalytic sites that are tunable through both framework design and post-synthetic modification. Despite a recent flurry of MOF photocatalyst demonstrations, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding their underlying photophysics and associated catalytic reaction mechanisms that impede rational optimization. This research is therefore geared toward a fundamental understanding of both the photophysical implications of MOF material modifications and how these modifications can strategically promote efficient photo(electro)catalysis. Optical transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy techniques, as a set of laser-based pump-probe methods used to gain information on excited state electronic structure and dynamics, are employed to monitor the photophysics and photoconductivity of these MOF systems as a continuous feedback loop to material design. Characterization of photocatalytic performance involves sustainability-minded benchmark reactions, such as CO2 reduction. NREL\u2019s longstanding expertise in applying these tools to problems involving photoinduced electron transfer and subsequent catalytic processes is intended to closely integrate with efforts at Rutgers-Newark on the materials-driven aspects of the project. Within the framework of the DOE-FAIR program, this mutually beneficial collaborative project involves extensive graduate student training on advanced spectroscopic and analytical tools and therefore is building crucial research capacity at Rutgers-Newark, a non-R1, minority serving (MSI) and emerging research institution (ERI)."

The knowledge acquired is foundational to controlling charge transfer and energy transfer from light to matter. This project will contribute new data to the research identified as new scientific opportunities in the 2018 BES Report, \u201cOpportunities for Basic Research at the Frontiers of X-ray FEL Ultrafast Science\u201d and fall within the Priority Research Opportunity (PRO1): \u201cProbing and controlling electron motion within a molecule\u201d. This research also supports the 2015 DOE Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee mission and report on \u201cChallenges at the Frontiers of Matter and Energy: Transformative Opportunities for Discovery Science\u201d."

Electron dynamics does indeed unfold on the time scale of tens to hundreds of attoseconds, and to probe it one therefore needs light sources that can provide attosecond time resolution. This project studies how bright, attosecond pulses of soft-X-ray radiation from state-of-the-art light sources are reshaped in the interaction with quantum matter. Understanding this reshaping in the time, frequency, and spatial domains is important in several ways: (i) the reshaping can be a signature of the dynamics that took place during the light-matter interaction, and (ii) reshaping of light is crucial to the development, characterization and control of next-generation light sources. Our program addresses both aspects, in service of the BES AMOS goal of understanding quantum dynamics at the fastest time scales. We study atto- and femtosecond pulse reshaping using a versatile theoretical treatment that takes account of both the strong laser-matter interaction at the single-system level, by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) in some approximation, and, when appropriate, the propagation of the radiation in the non-linear medium, by solving the Maxwell wave equation using the TDSE-calculated time-dependent polarization as a source term. Some studies are aimed at characterization and control of light pulses from free-electron and table-top laser sources, and other studies use the reshaping of light in gas- or condensed-phase media to learn about the ultrafast electron dynamics initiated by the short pulses.",

The aim is to understand and control the earliest time dynamics of chemical transformations after molecules absorb ultraviolet (UV) light, similar to what happens when human skin absorbs sunlight. These processes mimic the effects of sunlight on the molecules that are in either biological cells or other substances. The research seeks to measure the time evolution of these molecular transformations that occur in a one thousandth of a trillionth of a second. These molecular changes happen when the electrons that surround the molecule\u2019s nuclei absorb the light at a million times faster than a trillionth of a second, inducing nuclear motion. This motion modifies the molecules resulting in different chemical behavior or the formation of new molecules. These processes are at the heart of ultrafast chemistry. To perform these experiments, a microscope of unprecedented power, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) at SLAC National Laboratory, acts as a high-repetition rate strobe light. This X-ray laser freezes the motion of atoms, a frame at a time, to capture high-speed images of ultrafast microscopic chemical transformations, enabling the production of a molecular movie. One planned experiment will use the upgraded ultrafast LCLS-II X-rays and instrumentation to image UV-induced breaking of water molecules with the utmost precision. This study is important for not only fundamental science in chemistry, physics and biology, but also various technologies. Specifically, the experiments will measure the motion of electrons as they move across the water bonds on an ultrafast timescale by probing and characterizing the motion of the oxygen and the two hydrogen atoms in the water molecule during the initial stages of ultrafast chemical reactions. The research includes powerful calculations to provide a quantitative interpretation of the results. This area of fundamental research is crucial to chemical sciences because it probes the dynamics of electrons and nuclei in molecules and determines how these dynamics influence the transfer of energy, charge, or protons, as well as chemical bond breaking or formation of new bonds that make new molecules.

To perform these experiments, a microscope of unprecedented power, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) at SLAC National Laboratory, acts as a high-repetition rate strobe light. This X-ray laser freezes the motion of atoms, a frame at a time, to capture high-speed images of ultrafast microscopic chemical transformations, enabling the production of a molecular movie. One planned experiment will use the upgraded ultrafast LCLS-II X-rays and instrumentation to image UV-induced breaking of water molecules with the utmost precision. This study is important for not only fundamental science in chemistry, physics and biology, but also various technologies. Specifically, the experiments will measure the motion of electrons as they move across the water bonds on an ultrafast timescale by probing and characterizing the motion of the oxygen and the two hydrogen atoms in the water molecule during the initial stages of ultrafast chemical reactions. The research includes powerful calculations to provide a quantitative interpretation of the results. This area of fundamental research is crucial to chemical sciences because it probes the dynamics of electrons and nuclei in molecules and determines how these dynamics influence the transfer of energy, charge, or protons, as well as chemical bond breaking or formation of new bonds that make new molecules. The knowledge acquired is foundational to controlling charge transfer and energy transfer from light to matter. This project will contribute new data to the research identified as new scientific opportunities in the 2018 BES Report, \u201cOpportunities for Basic Research at the Frontiers of X-ray FEL Ultrafast Science\u201d and fall within the Priority Research Opportunity (PRO1): \u201cProbing and controlling electron motion within a molecule\u201d. This research also supports the 2015 DOE Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee mission and report on \u201cChallenges at the Frontiers of Matter and Energy: Transformative Opportunities for Discovery Science\u201d."

Suits, University of Missouri, Columbia The goals of this experimental program are to develop the most detailed picture possible of the dynamics of the elementary chemical reactions that underlie gas phase chemical processes. Such studies are essential to build a deeper understanding of the chemical behavior of macroscopic gas phase systems and to permit reliable extrapolation of measured quantities from known conditions of temperature and pressure to extreme conditions\u00ad \u2013 from interstellar clouds at 10 K to combustion systems at 2000 K \u2013 where measurements are not feasible. These investigations are conducted using state-of-the-art molecular beam machines in conjunction with velocity map ion imaging and other advanced spectroscopic techniques. A significant aspect of this work is the development of new instruments and approaches to achieve new insights. Studies include bimolecular reactions of polyatomic molecules with atomic and molecular radicals performed under single collision conditions; time-resolved investigations of photodissociation and unimolecular decomposition, and low temperature kinetics and product branching measurements obtained using rotational spectroscopy. A notable aspect of this effort is the close interplay with theoretical investigations of the structure and dynamics of the systems of interest, either performed in-house or in collaboration with theory colleagues, to develop a molecular-level understanding of chemical phenomena. The overall objectives of our program are: to extend the range of powerful dynamics studies to more complex polyatomic systems; to reveal thereby novel aspects of dynamics that arise with increasing molecular complexity; to identify novel reaction pathways; and to benchmark a range of theoretical methods. The specific objectives of this renewal project are to explore kinetics and dynamics of ground state sulfur atom reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons and to advance the methods and applications of laboratory-based Coulomb Explosion Imaging (CEI).Three experimental avenues are pursued in the proposed studies building on current progress: Crossed-beam velocity map imaging studies of sulfur atom reactions with polyatomic targets; related studies of the low temperature kinetics and branching in these reactions; and development of the capability for time-resolved structural dynamics in molecules using CEI. The crossed-beam studies directly yield the velocity-flux contour maps for the reactions that, in combination with high-level theoretical calculations, provide deep insight into reaction pathways and dynamics, the existence of barriers and intermediate reaction complexes, and highlight systematic trends in mechanisms and energy and angular momentum partitioning as a function of target structure.

The photocatalytic activity is known to be highly heterogeneous both in an ensemble of nanomaterials and within a single particle. Despite significant research activity, the understanding of photocatalytic heterogeneity remains incomplete. We propose to use nanoelectrochemical techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to carry out quantitative, spatially resolved photoelectrochemical experiments aimed at measuring photo(electro)catalytic activity and characterizing heterogeneity of a wide range of semiconductor nanomaterials. We will perform extensive experimental studies and computer modeling aimed at probing photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting at single semiconductor particles. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) will be employed to measure hydrogen and oxygen fluxes generated at single semiconductor micro/nanocrystals. A recently developed experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements at the nanoscale, in which a glass-sealed tip simultaneously serves as a nanoelectrode and a light guide, will be used to evaluate local rates of water splitting processes on different facets and near facet edges of doped BiVO4 microcrystals and map oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) rates on Al-doped SrTiO3 cubes modified with RhxCryOz. A novel methodology will be developed for photo-electrochemical experiments at a single microcrystal attached to a nanoelectrode. Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalytic reactivity of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (MoS2 and others) exfoliated nanoflakes and monolayers will be mapped using two modes of photo-SECM. The generation/collection mode with small nanotips will be used to map HER active sites, and mathematical modeling and finite-element simulations will be performed to extract quantitative kinetic information from the experimental data. The tunneling mode of photo-SECM will be developed and used for ultrahigh resolution imaging of surface reactivity of 2D materials. The anticipated results will contribute to the understanding of factors influencing the activity and stability of 2D photoelectrocatalysts and help to improve these properties. We will employ nanoelectrochemical approaches to put forward new strategies for development of catalysts for photoelectrosynthesis.

Although crossed molecular beam experiments have been employed for almost five decades, there is a critical lack of understanding on the elementary mechanisms how to synthesize fundamental molecular building blocks carrying six- and five-membered rings due to the previously insurmountable difficulties in preparing supersonic molecular beams of radical reactants of a sufficient high intensity to detect the reaction products under single collision conditions. Considering the high reactivity of the open shell reactants, crossed molecular beam experiments, in which the reactants are prepared in separate side chambers, present a logical experimental approach. The results of the scattering experiments are combined with ab initio calculations (Mebel) and flame modeling (Frenklach). This approach not only resolves a decade old enigma of how simple aromatic building blocks are formed in combustion and extraterrestrial settings, but also how these elementary reactions drive molecular mass growth processes via two- (flat) and three-dimensional (bowl-shaped) aromatic nanostructures ultimately to carbonaceous nanoparticles.",

To achieve these goals, we conduct state-of-the-art crossed molecular beam experiments over a wide range of collision energies from 10 to 100 kJmol-1 in a hydrocarbon-free, crossed molecular beam machine with ultra-sensitive detection schemes coupled to a universal and rotatable angular resolved time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector with soft and hard electron impact ionization and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Although crossed molecular beam experiments have been employed for almost five decades, there is a critical lack of understanding on the elementary mechanisms how to synthesize fundamental molecular building blocks carrying six- and five-membered rings due to the previously insurmountable difficulties in preparing supersonic molecular beams of radical reactants of a sufficient high intensity to detect the reaction products under single collision conditions. Considering the high reactivity of the open shell reactants, crossed molecular beam experiments, in which the reactants are prepared in separate side chambers, present a logical experimental approach. The results of the scattering experiments are combined with ab initio calculations (Mebel) and flame modeling (Frenklach). This approach not only resolves a decade old enigma of how simple aromatic building blocks are formed in combustion and extraterrestrial settings, but also how these elementary reactions drive molecular mass growth processes via two- (flat) and three-dimensional (bowl-shaped) aromatic nanostructures ultimately to carbonaceous nanoparticles."

Such a vast range in unimolecular decay rates has potentially important implications for the relative importance of critical pathways in Earth's lower atmosphere and low-temperature combustion, such as autoxidation, particle formation, and autoignition. However, the predicted unimolecular decay rates of functionalized peroxy radical are largely uncharacterized due to experimental challenges. Understanding the unimolecular decay of functionalized peroxy radicals demands a holistic approach that uses multiple experimental and theoretical methods. Therefore, their chemistry will be investigated directly in separate complementary experiments at Coastal Carolina University using a new appartus to study the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals under jet-cooled and collision-free conditions, and at Argonne National Laboratory under thermal conditions, in which the reactivity of peroxy radicals will be studied at a specific temperature and pressure. In both experiments, the peroxy radicals will be generated and stabilized under conditions that minimize unwanted side chemistry and allow direct observation of their unimolecular decay in fundamental pump-probe laser experiments. Peroxy radicals with carbonyl and carboxylic acid functionalization will be specifically targeted due to low energy barriers for their hydrogen atom migration reactions. The results from the experiments will be compared with state-of-the-art theoretical calculations of the predicted unimolecular decay reaction dynamics and kinetics using methods developed at Argonne National Laboratory.

Caravan2, Dr. Stephen J. Klippenstein2 1: Coastal Carolina University, Conway, SC 29526 2: Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL 60439 The objectives of this research are to implement innovative experimental and theoretical techniques to study the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals. Furthermore, the research aligns with the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) funding opportunity announcement goals by establishing a partnership between Argonne National Laboratory and Coastal Carolina University, a primarily undergraduate and emerging research institution. Peroxy radicals are reactive organic intermediates ubiquitous in the chemistry of oxygenated environments. The fate of peroxy radicals is highly dependent on the functionalization of the peroxy radical and the conditions of the local environment, such as temperature, pressure, and co-reactant concentrations. Hydrogen atom migration reactions are critical in the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals: they impact the propensity for the recycling of hydroxyl radicals (an important oxidant), and play a central role in autoxidation, which leads to molecular weight growth and particle formation. Biomolecular reactions of peroxy radicals can compete with unimolecular decay, affecting tropospheric ozone concentrations and the formation of low-volatility molecules. The competition between peroxy radical reactivity between unimolecular decay and bimolecular reaction is sensitive to the rate of the hydrogen atom migration reactions, which highly depends on the functionalization of the peroxy radical. Recent theoretical investigations have shown that the H-atom migration rates of peroxy radicals with different functional groups can vary by as much as fifteen orders of magnitude. Such a vast range in unimolecular decay rates has potentially important implications for the relative importance of critical pathways in Earth's lower atmosphere and low-temperature combustion, such as autoxidation, particle formation, and autoignition. However, the predicted unimolecular decay rates of functionalized peroxy radical are largely uncharacterized due to experimental challenges. Understanding the unimolecular decay of functionalized peroxy radicals demands a holistic approach that uses multiple experimental and theoretical methods.

Planar PAHs such as coronene (C24H12) require six-membered rings as present in the benzene moieties; non-planar PAHs such as corannulene (C20H10) along with nanobowls, nanotubes, and fullerenes call for five-membered cyclic building blocks to transit planar molecular structures out of the plane. Five-membered rings annulated to a seven-membered cyclic moiety ring such as in azulene access contorted, \u2018saddle-shaped\u2019 aromatic systems with both a positive and negative curvature of the carbon backbone. This classifies benzene, phenyl, fulveneallene, and fulvenallenyl as fundamental molecular building blocks to complex PAHs and eventually carbonaceous nanoparticles. The intimate knowledge of the elementary mechanisms to synthesize these molecules is therefore critical to our understanding of the early stage chemistry in hydrocarbon- rich environments (combustion, molecular clouds) how PAHs and ultimately carbonaceous nanoparticles form. However, the elementary steps, reaction dynamics, energy flow processes, and mechanisms to form even these chemically simple building blocks on the molecular level are still highly debated as synthetic routes have not been investigated comprehensively under single collision conditions to date. To achieve these goals, we conduct state-of-the-art crossed molecular beam experiments over a wide range of collision energies from 10 to 100 kJmol-1 in a hydrocarbon-free, crossed molecular beam machine with ultra-sensitive detection schemes coupled to a universal and rotatable angular resolved time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector with soft and hard electron impact ionization and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Although crossed molecular beam experiments have been employed for almost five decades, there is a critical lack of understanding on the elementary mechanisms how to synthesize fundamental molecular building blocks carrying six- and five-membered rings due to the previously insurmountable difficulties in preparing supersonic molecular beams of radical reactants of a sufficient high intensity to detect the reaction products under single collision conditions. Considering the high reactivity of the open shell reactants, crossed molecular beam experiments, in which the reactants are prepared in separate side chambers, present a logical experimental approach. The results of the scattering experiments are combined with ab initio calculations (Mebel) and flame modeling (Frenklach). This approach not only resolves a decade old enigma of how simple aromatic building blocks are formed in combustion and extraterrestrial settings, but also how these elementary reactions drive molecular mass growth processes via two- (flat) and three-dimensional (bowl-shaped) aromatic nanostructures ultimately to carbonaceous nanoparticles."

Caravan2, Dr. Stephen J. Klippenstein2 1: Coastal Carolina University, Conway, SC 29526 2: Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL 60439 The objectives of this research are to implement innovative experimental and theoretical techniques to study the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals. Furthermore, the research aligns with the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) funding opportunity announcement goals by establishing a partnership between Argonne National Laboratory and Coastal Carolina University, a primarily undergraduate and emerging research institution. Peroxy radicals are reactive organic intermediates ubiquitous in the chemistry of oxygenated environments. The fate of peroxy radicals is highly dependent on the functionalization of the peroxy radical and the conditions of the local environment, such as temperature, pressure, and co-reactant concentrations. Hydrogen atom migration reactions are critical in the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals: they impact the propensity for the recycling of hydroxyl radicals (an important oxidant), and play a central role in autoxidation, which leads to molecular weight growth and particle formation. Biomolecular reactions of peroxy radicals can compete with unimolecular decay, affecting tropospheric ozone concentrations and the formation of low-volatility molecules. The competition between peroxy radical reactivity between unimolecular decay and bimolecular reaction is sensitive to the rate of the hydrogen atom migration reactions, which highly depends on the functionalization of the peroxy radical. Recent theoretical investigations have shown that the H-atom migration rates of peroxy radicals with different functional groups can vary by as much as fifteen orders of magnitude. Such a vast range in unimolecular decay rates has potentially important implications for the relative importance of critical pathways in Earth's lower atmosphere and low-temperature combustion, such as autoxidation, particle formation, and autoignition. However, the predicted unimolecular decay rates of functionalized peroxy radical are largely uncharacterized due to experimental challenges. Understanding the unimolecular decay of functionalized peroxy radicals demands a holistic approach that uses multiple experimental and theoretical methods.

Five-membered rings annulated to a seven-membered cyclic moiety ring such as in azulene access contorted, \u2018saddle-shaped\u2019 aromatic systems with both a positive and negative curvature of the carbon backbone. This classifies benzene, phenyl, fulveneallene, and fulvenallenyl as fundamental molecular building blocks to complex PAHs and eventually carbonaceous nanoparticles. The intimate knowledge of the elementary mechanisms to synthesize these molecules is therefore critical to our understanding of the early stage chemistry in hydrocarbon- rich environments (combustion, molecular clouds) how PAHs and ultimately carbonaceous nanoparticles form. However, the elementary steps, reaction dynamics, energy flow processes, and mechanisms to form even these chemically simple building blocks on the molecular level are still highly debated as synthetic routes have not been investigated comprehensively under single collision conditions to date. To achieve these goals, we conduct state-of-the-art crossed molecular beam experiments over a wide range of collision energies from 10 to 100 kJmol-1 in a hydrocarbon-free, crossed molecular beam machine with ultra-sensitive detection schemes coupled to a universal and rotatable angular resolved time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector with soft and hard electron impact ionization and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Although crossed molecular beam experiments have been employed for almost five decades, there is a critical lack of understanding on the elementary mechanisms how to synthesize fundamental molecular building blocks carrying six- and five-membered rings due to the previously insurmountable difficulties in preparing supersonic molecular beams of radical reactants of a sufficient high intensity to detect the reaction products under single collision conditions. Considering the high reactivity of the open shell reactants, crossed molecular beam experiments, in which the reactants are prepared in separate side chambers, present a logical experimental approach. The results of the scattering experiments are combined with ab initio calculations (Mebel) and flame modeling (Frenklach). This approach not only resolves a decade old enigma of how simple aromatic building blocks are formed in combustion and extraterrestrial settings, but also how these elementary reactions drive molecular mass growth processes via two- (flat) and three-dimensional (bowl-shaped) aromatic nanostructures ultimately to carbonaceous nanoparticles."

Caravan2, Dr. Stephen J. Klippenstein2 1: Coastal Carolina University, Conway, SC 29526 2: Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL 60439 The objectives of this research are to implement innovative experimental and theoretical techniques to study the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals. Furthermore, the research aligns with the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) funding opportunity announcement goals by establishing a partnership between Argonne National Laboratory and Coastal Carolina University, a primarily undergraduate and emerging research institution. Peroxy radicals are reactive organic intermediates ubiquitous in the chemistry of oxygenated environments. The fate of peroxy radicals is highly dependent on the functionalization of the peroxy radical and the conditions of the local environment, such as temperature, pressure, and co-reactant concentrations. Hydrogen atom migration reactions are critical in the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals: they impact the propensity for the recycling of hydroxyl radicals (an important oxidant), and play a central role in autoxidation, which leads to molecular weight growth and particle formation. Biomolecular reactions of peroxy radicals can compete with unimolecular decay, affecting tropospheric ozone concentrations and the formation of low-volatility molecules. The competition between peroxy radical reactivity between unimolecular decay and bimolecular reaction is sensitive to the rate of the hydrogen atom migration reactions, which highly depends on the functionalization of the peroxy radical. Recent theoretical investigations have shown that the H-atom migration rates of peroxy radicals with different functional groups can vary by as much as fifteen orders of magnitude. Such a vast range in unimolecular decay rates has potentially important implications for the relative importance of critical pathways in Earth's lower atmosphere and low-temperature combustion, such as autoxidation, particle formation, and autoignition. However, the predicted unimolecular decay rates of functionalized peroxy radical are largely uncharacterized due to experimental challenges.

Suits, University of Missouri, Columbia The goals of this experimental program are to develop the most detailed picture possible of the dynamics of the elementary chemical reactions that underlie gas phase chemical processes. Such studies are essential to build a deeper understanding of the chemical behavior of macroscopic gas phase systems and to permit reliable extrapolation of measured quantities from known conditions of temperature and pressure to extreme conditions\u00ad \u2013 from interstellar clouds at 10 K to combustion systems at 2000 K \u2013 where measurements are not feasible. These investigations are conducted using state-of-the-art molecular beam machines in conjunction with velocity map ion imaging and other advanced spectroscopic techniques. A significant aspect of this work is the development of new instruments and approaches to achieve new insights. Studies include bimolecular reactions of polyatomic molecules with atomic and molecular radicals performed under single collision conditions; time-resolved investigations of photodissociation and unimolecular decomposition, and low temperature kinetics and product branching measurements obtained using rotational spectroscopy. A notable aspect of this effort is the close interplay with theoretical investigations of the structure and dynamics of the systems of interest, either performed in-house or in collaboration with theory colleagues, to develop a molecular-level understanding of chemical phenomena. The overall objectives of our program are: to extend the range of powerful dynamics studies to more complex polyatomic systems; to reveal thereby novel aspects of dynamics that arise with increasing molecular complexity; to identify novel reaction pathways; and to benchmark a range of theoretical methods. The specific objectives of this renewal project are to explore kinetics and dynamics of ground state sulfur atom reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons and to advance the methods and applications of laboratory-based Coulomb Explosion Imaging (CEI).Three experimental avenues are pursued in the proposed studies building on current progress: Crossed-beam velocity map imaging studies of sulfur atom reactions with polyatomic targets; related studies of the low temperature kinetics and branching in these reactions; and development of the capability for time-resolved structural dynamics in molecules using CEI. The crossed-beam studies directly yield the velocity-flux contour maps for the reactions that, in combination with high-level theoretical calculations, provide deep insight into reaction pathways and dynamics, the existence of barriers and intermediate reaction complexes, and highlight systematic trends in mechanisms and energy and angular momentum partitioning as a function of target structure.

The intimate knowledge of the elementary mechanisms to synthesize these molecules is therefore critical to our understanding of the early stage chemistry in hydrocarbon- rich environments (combustion, molecular clouds) how PAHs and ultimately carbonaceous nanoparticles form. However, the elementary steps, reaction dynamics, energy flow processes, and mechanisms to form even these chemically simple building blocks on the molecular level are still highly debated as synthetic routes have not been investigated comprehensively under single collision conditions to date. To achieve these goals, we conduct state-of-the-art crossed molecular beam experiments over a wide range of collision energies from 10 to 100 kJmol-1 in a hydrocarbon-free, crossed molecular beam machine with ultra-sensitive detection schemes coupled to a universal and rotatable angular resolved time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector with soft and hard electron impact ionization and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Although crossed molecular beam experiments have been employed for almost five decades, there is a critical lack of understanding on the elementary mechanisms how to synthesize fundamental molecular building blocks carrying six- and five-membered rings due to the previously insurmountable difficulties in preparing supersonic molecular beams of radical reactants of a sufficient high intensity to detect the reaction products under single collision conditions. Considering the high reactivity of the open shell reactants, crossed molecular beam experiments, in which the reactants are prepared in separate side chambers, present a logical experimental approach. The results of the scattering experiments are combined with ab initio calculations (Mebel) and flame modeling (Frenklach). This approach not only resolves a decade old enigma of how simple aromatic building blocks are formed in combustion and extraterrestrial settings, but also how these elementary reactions drive molecular mass growth processes via two- (flat) and three-dimensional (bowl-shaped) aromatic nanostructures ultimately to carbonaceous nanoparticles."

Caravan2, Dr. Stephen J. Klippenstein2 1: Coastal Carolina University, Conway, SC 29526 2: Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL 60439 The objectives of this research are to implement innovative experimental and theoretical techniques to study the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals. Furthermore, the research aligns with the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) funding opportunity announcement goals by establishing a partnership between Argonne National Laboratory and Coastal Carolina University, a primarily undergraduate and emerging research institution. Peroxy radicals are reactive organic intermediates ubiquitous in the chemistry of oxygenated environments. The fate of peroxy radicals is highly dependent on the functionalization of the peroxy radical and the conditions of the local environment, such as temperature, pressure, and co-reactant concentrations. Hydrogen atom migration reactions are critical in the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals: they impact the propensity for the recycling of hydroxyl radicals (an important oxidant), and play a central role in autoxidation, which leads to molecular weight growth and particle formation. Biomolecular reactions of peroxy radicals can compete with unimolecular decay, affecting tropospheric ozone concentrations and the formation of low-volatility molecules. The competition between peroxy radical reactivity between unimolecular decay and bimolecular reaction is sensitive to the rate of the hydrogen atom migration reactions, which highly depends on the functionalization of the peroxy radical. Recent theoretical investigations have shown that the H-atom migration rates of peroxy radicals with different functional groups can vary by as much as fifteen orders of magnitude. Such a vast range in unimolecular decay rates has potentially important implications for the relative importance of critical pathways in Earth's lower atmosphere and low-temperature combustion, such as autoxidation, particle formation, and autoignition. However, the predicted unimolecular decay rates of functionalized peroxy radical are largely uncharacterized due to experimental challenges.

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions. Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures.

          "public_abstract": "An Integrated Electrochemical Approach to the Precision Synthesis of Sustainable Catalyst Materials Michelle L. Personick, University of Virginia (Principal Investigator) Platinum group elements (PGE) such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium are key components in many energy storage technologies, including fuel cells and the sustainable production of liquid fuels using renewable electricity. However, the relative scarcity of these elements creates problems for scale up and implementation of sustainable energy technologies due to the high prices of these elements and uncertainty in their sourcing. This instability in the supply chain can also cause problems for national security. Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE. This proposal addresses a significant fundamental knowledge gap in the synthesis of non-PGE nanoparticles with well-defined shapes. Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications. The integrated electrochemical approach to be employed in this work introduces unique flexibility in synthetic design that will enable both enhanced fundamental insight into non-PGE metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms and the development of innovative synthesis approaches that move beyond the classic conditions employed in the field. Using real-time electrochemical measurements, our integrated approach allows us to define desired parameters for the selection of novel reaction conditions for nanoparticle synthesis, thus breaking the boundaries of literature precedent. In addition, we will probe the mechanistic roles of components such as surfactants and shape-directing agents in ways that are not possible using colloidal synthesis development approaches, providing a more complete understanding of the critically important role of these additives in colloidal growth. Finally, our electrochemical synthesis makes it possible to precisely tune the reaction conditions at each step of nanoparticle growth while also providing real-time insight into the impact of changing reaction conditions. It is thus a powerful tool for the precision design and implementation of nanoparticle syntheses that control the dynamics of reaction chemistry in a way that is well outside the limits of what is possible with existing methods. Coupled with these efforts, the successful development of methods for synthesizing nanoparticles of non-PGE with tailored surface facets\u2014including high-energy stepped surfaces\u2014will also provide a platform for a reduction in the use of PGE and noble metals without necessarily needing to replace them completely.

Crossed molecular beam experiments are conducted under single-collision conditions and investigate the underlying energetics, dynamics, and potential energy surfaces (PESs) of reactions of key resonantly stabilized free radicals (RSFR, cyclopentadienyl, C5H5) and aromatic radicals (AR, phenyl, C6H5) as simplest representatives of five- and six-membered, cyclic hydrocarbon radicals, prototype \u2018aliphatic\u2019 radicals (methylidyne; CH), \u2018acetylenic\u2019 radicals (ethynyl, C2H; butadiynyl, C4H), and \u2018carbonaceous\u2019 transients (C, C2, C3) with unsaturated C2 to C5 hydrocarbons at the most fundamental, microscopic level. These reactions access two classes of fundamental molecular building blocks of two- and threedimensional carbonaceous nanostructures carrying a six- and five-membered ring, respectively: benzene (C6H6) and phenyl (C6H5) along with fulveneallene (C7H6) and fulvenallenyl (C7H5). Planar PAHs such as coronene (C24H12) require six-membered rings as present in the benzene moieties; non-planar PAHs such as corannulene (C20H10) along with nanobowls, nanotubes, and fullerenes call for five-membered cyclic building blocks to transit planar molecular structures out of the plane. Five-membered rings annulated to a seven-membered cyclic moiety ring such as in azulene access contorted, \u2018saddle-shaped\u2019 aromatic systems with both a positive and negative curvature of the carbon backbone.

Suits, University of Missouri, Columbia The goals of this experimental program are to develop the most detailed picture possible of the dynamics of the elementary chemical reactions that underlie gas phase chemical processes. Such studies are essential to build a deeper understanding of the chemical behavior of macroscopic gas phase systems and to permit reliable extrapolation of measured quantities from known conditions of temperature and pressure to extreme conditions\u00ad \u2013 from interstellar clouds at 10 K to combustion systems at 2000 K \u2013 where measurements are not feasible. These investigations are conducted using state-of-the-art molecular beam machines in conjunction with velocity map ion imaging and other advanced spectroscopic techniques. A significant aspect of this work is the development of new instruments and approaches to achieve new insights. Studies include bimolecular reactions of polyatomic molecules with atomic and molecular radicals performed under single collision conditions; time-resolved investigations of photodissociation and unimolecular decomposition, and low temperature kinetics and product branching measurements obtained using rotational spectroscopy. A notable aspect of this effort is the close interplay with theoretical investigations of the structure and dynamics of the systems of interest, either performed in-house or in collaboration with theory colleagues, to develop a molecular-level understanding of chemical phenomena. The overall objectives of our program are: to extend the range of powerful dynamics studies to more complex polyatomic systems; to reveal thereby novel aspects of dynamics that arise with increasing molecular complexity; to identify novel reaction pathways; and to benchmark a range of theoretical methods. The specific objectives of this renewal project are to explore kinetics and dynamics of ground state sulfur atom reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons and to advance the methods and applications of laboratory-based Coulomb Explosion Imaging (CEI).Three experimental avenues are pursued in the proposed studies building on current progress: Crossed-beam velocity map imaging studies of sulfur atom reactions with polyatomic targets; related studies of the low temperature kinetics and branching in these reactions; and development of the capability for time-resolved structural dynamics in molecules using CEI. The crossed-beam studies directly yield the velocity-flux contour maps for the reactions that, in combination with high-level theoretical calculations, provide deep insight into reaction pathways and dynamics, the existence of barriers and intermediate reaction complexes, and highlight systematic trends in mechanisms and energy and angular momentum partitioning as a function of target structure.

Such studies will allow us to systematically explore the unimolecular dissociation reaction of the KRb2 collisional complex, arising from the endother- mic Rb + KRb reaction, as exit channels are opened or closed, dramatically changing its dissociation rate. Further, it may be possible to tune the energy of this complex through resonance with an exit channel using external fields, thereby allowing us to control the product distribution. Such work will be performed with state-to-state resolution of both the atomic and molecular products, made possible by the recent development of an optical Rydberg excitation apparatus in our instrument. This hardware further enables the study of highly-excited reactants, namely Rydberg Rb + KRb, which are of particular interest at these low temperatures as the collision energies are insufficient to directly ionize these atomic states, allowing for their interactions between ultracold partners to dominate.

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales. The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions.

The research includes three overarching tasks: (1) advancing our multi-system modeling framework, with specific emphasis on our multi-system risk triage platform, a new scenario discovery visualization tool and methods for extreme event prediction; (2) investigating a set of use cases in the Mississippi River Basin with focus on (a) human-natural system interactions and upstream-downstream dynamics, and (b) transportation infrastructure in multisector systems; and (3) stress-testing interconnected systems in the Basin by bringing together components of the use cases to test strategic pairings in order to investigate compounding stressors, propagating risks, tipping points and resilience. Throughout these tasks we will explore the generalizability and extensibility of both MSD tools and insights while advancing MSD understanding and frontier methods/tools. We expect this project to have a broad range of impacts. It will result in new methods, tools, and an integrated multi-system modeling framework that includes new linkages among systems, sectors and scales. This will advance the frontier of MSD capabilities, while developing better understanding of cross-scale modeling and model interoperability. A subset of the tools developed will be interactive community platforms that can be used by a range of researchers and decision-makers. Application of these tools to the use cases will provide new insights into the Mississippi River Basin, while also pushing the boundaries of MSD research into new areas, including transportation and important human-natural interactions related to air and water quality, human health and well-being. The stress-testing of paired systems will provide understanding of system-of-systems responses to compounding stresses and how the scope of study can affect individual sector/system outcomes and responses. In addition, the project will foster stronger collaboration within the MSD community of practice, and advance MSD understanding, capabilities and generalizable insights."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions.

An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments.

The research includes three overarching tasks: (1) advancing our multi-system modeling framework, with specific emphasis on our multi-system risk triage platform, a new scenario discovery visualization tool and methods for extreme event prediction; (2) investigating a set of use cases in the Mississippi River Basin with focus on (a) human-natural system interactions and upstream-downstream dynamics, and (b) transportation infrastructure in multisector systems; and (3) stress-testing interconnected systems in the Basin by bringing together components of the use cases to test strategic pairings in order to investigate compounding stressors, propagating risks, tipping points and resilience. Throughout these tasks we will explore the generalizability and extensibility of both MSD tools and insights while advancing MSD understanding and frontier methods/tools. We expect this project to have a broad range of impacts. It will result in new methods, tools, and an integrated multi-system modeling framework that includes new linkages among systems, sectors and scales. This will advance the frontier of MSD capabilities, while developing better understanding of cross-scale modeling and model interoperability. A subset of the tools developed will be interactive community platforms that can be used by a range of researchers and decision-makers. Application of these tools to the use cases will provide new insights into the Mississippi River Basin, while also pushing the boundaries of MSD research into new areas, including transportation and important human-natural interactions related to air and water quality, human health and well-being. The stress-testing of paired systems will provide understanding of system-of-systems responses to compounding stresses and how the scope of study can affect individual sector/system outcomes and responses. In addition, the project will foster stronger collaboration within the MSD community of practice, and advance MSD understanding, capabilities and generalizable insights."

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions. The research objectives of the project include the development of deep learning architectures and algorithms that will assimilate earthquake simulations and ground motion observations into a hybrid earthquake scenario generator; the development of a schema to test the intensity measures and spatial variability statistics of the generated earthquake scenarios against published empirical models and simulations outside the learning dataset; the extension of the simulated and hybrid generated spatial coverage offshore; the development of algorithms to add realistic high frequency distributions to ECP simulators learned from observations; the epistemic uncertainty quantification of the generated ground motions to guide future investments in data harvesting and algorithmic development; and the synthesis of the hybrid generator into a risk assessment framework for an interconnected clean energy network, which will enable the DOE to evaluate alternative risk reduction solutions. While the hybrid earthquake scenario generator will provide an essential capability for ensuring the resiliency and cost-effectiveness of future energy systems to earthquake risk, the framework that will be developed as part of this project will open transformative possibilities to regional-scale distributed infrastructure system resilience assessment and risk reduction more broadly. Since the machine learning algorithms will be agnostic to the earthquake source and wave propagation physics that lie under the hood, we envision the hybridized framework as a stepping stone to assessing resilience and risk associated with other hazards threatening energy systems, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and combinations thereof."

An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually. It is home to many strong connections between land, water, energy, and transportation as well as subject to multiple extreme events (e.g. floods, droughts and heat waves) and other abrupt and gradual changes (e.g. related to economic and population growth, energy transitions, land use changes, demand changes, etc.), making it well-suited for MSD research. Using this geographic area to focus the research, we willpursue a broader goal of better understanding forces and patterns, stabilities and instabilities, foresight, and the resilience of co-evolving systems in the context of multiple and compounding human and environmental stressors. In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales.

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales. The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities.

The research includes three overarching tasks: (1) advancing our multi-system modeling framework, with specific emphasis on our multi-system risk triage platform, a new scenario discovery visualization tool and methods for extreme event prediction; (2) investigating a set of use cases in the Mississippi River Basin with focus on (a) human-natural system interactions and upstream-downstream dynamics, and (b) transportation infrastructure in multisector systems; and (3) stress-testing interconnected systems in the Basin by bringing together components of the use cases to test strategic pairings in order to investigate compounding stressors, propagating risks, tipping points and resilience. Throughout these tasks we will explore the generalizability and extensibility of both MSD tools and insights while advancing MSD understanding and frontier methods/tools. We expect this project to have a broad range of impacts. It will result in new methods, tools, and an integrated multi-system modeling framework that includes new linkages among systems, sectors and scales.

Asimaki, California Institute of Technology, Principal investigator Z.E. Ross, California Institute of Technology, Co-Investigator D.B. McCallen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Co-Investigator E. Taciroglu, University of California, Los Angeles, Co-Investigator The U.S. DOE Earthshots initiative targets the development of clean energy systems to disrupt the evolving impact of global climate change. To meet the aggressive clean energy objectives set by the DOE, ensuring resilience of these systems against natural hazards, without catastrophic failure or unacceptably diminished clean energy function, will be essential. Across the Western U.S. and other regions of elevated seismic hazard, this will include developing system resilience against destructive earthquakes. Developing the safety case of a regionally distributed hydrogen storage and distribution system and reliable anchorage and distribution systems for large deep-water floating offshore turbine platforms are just two exemplars of unique seismic safety challenges that will need to be addressed through focused research and development. In the case of floating offshore systems, for example, it is noted that the two designated offshore wind tracts located off the California coast are both in regions of very high seismic hazard. In the push to achieve clean energy systems, safety and resilience must be a paramount system end state, and reliable earthquake-resistant design will be a requirement cross-cutting all these new systems. In this project, we will leverage recent DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) developments in high-performance computing and cutting-edge advancements in deep learning to fundamentally advance a capability for predicting the response of energy systems to major damaging earthquakes. Through the synergistic integration of simulation and observational data, this work will bridge the gap between historical statistic-based empirical earthquake models and the recently advanced physics-based large-scale earthquake simulations to build a hybrid earthquake generator that will learn from both simulations and data. A particular focus will be the inclusion of synthetic data from simulations of unobserved large scenario earthquakes with data from more frequently occurring smaller observed earthquakes that encapsulate the imprint of subsurface geologic structure at fine spatial scale to enhance the prediction of high-frequency ground motions.

          "public_abstract": "This project aims to advance MultiSector Dynamics (MSD) research and methods by enhancing and combining multi-disciplinary tools, analytic methods, and visualization platforms to explore the implications of influences, stressors, and risks for complex interconnected physical and socio-economic systems. An underpinning motivation of MSD research is the recognition that society is under continual exposure to changing and co-evolving risks across interconnected systems. These risks operate across a variety of time and spatial scales, and our research focuses on the potential differential responses to slowly evolving forces versus changes in extreme events. To achieve these insights, we will advance and utilize a multi-system, multisector modeling framework to explore a set of use cases and experiments. Our project focuses on the Mississippi River Basin, a critically important region that is the 4th largest watershed in the world, produces 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural exports, moves 175 million tons of freight each year, and contains up to 326 thermoelectric power plants generating 227 GW of power annually. It is home to many strong connections between land, water, energy, and transportation as well as subject to multiple extreme events (e.g. floods, droughts and heat waves) and other abrupt and gradual changes (e.g. related to economic and population growth, energy transitions, land use changes, demand changes, etc.), making it well-suited for MSD research. Using this geographic area to focus the research, we willpursue a broader goal of better understanding forces and patterns, stabilities and instabilities, foresight, and the resilience of co-evolving systems in the context of multiple and compounding human and environmental stressors. In exploring the convergence of human and natural systems and stressors in this region, we seek to develop methods and acquire insights that have the potential to be transferred and extended to other regions, and more generally investigate the scope, specificity, model forms, details, interoperability and data requirements for meaningful understanding of dynamics spanning scales. The research includes three overarching tasks: (1) advancing our multi-system modeling framework, with specific emphasis on our multi-system risk triage platform, a new scenario discovery visualization tool and methods for extreme event prediction; (2) investigating a set of use cases in the Mississippi River Basin with focus on (a) human-natural system interactions and upstream-downstream dynamics, and (b) transportation infrastructure in multisector systems; and (3) stress-testing interconnected systems in the Basin by bringing together components of the use cases to test strategic pairings in order to investigate compounding stressors, propagating risks, tipping points and resilience. Throughout these tasks we will explore the generalizability and extensibility of both MSD tools and insights while advancing MSD understanding and frontier methods/tools. We expect this project to have a broad range of impacts. It will result in new methods, tools, and an integrated multi-system modeling framework that includes new linkages among systems, sectors and scales. This will advance the frontier of MSD capabilities, while developing better understanding of cross-scale modeling and model interoperability. A subset of the tools developed will be interactive community platforms that can be used by a range of researchers and decision-makers. Application of these tools to the use cases will provide new insights into the Mississippi River Basin, while also pushing the boundaries of MSD research into new areas, including transportation and important human-natural interactions related to air and water quality, human health and well-being. The stress-testing of paired systems will provide understanding of system-of-systems responses to compounding stresses and how the scope of study can affect individual sector/system outcomes and responses. In addition, the project will foster stronger collaboration within the MSD community of practice, and advance MSD understanding, capabilities and generalizable insights."

We propose to establish M2dt, a center for research and education on multifaceted mathematical foundations of predictive digital twins (DTs) for complex systems. A DT is a computational model that evolves over time to persistently represent the structure, behavior, and context of a unique physical system or process. DTs are characterized by a dynamic and continuous two-way flow of information between the computational model and the physical system. Data streams from the physical system are assimilated into the computational model to reduce uncertainties and improve predictions, which in turn are used as a basis for controlling the physical system, optimizing data acquisition, and providing decision support.

Target applications. The potential impacts of DTs are enormous and cut across every DOE mission area. Just a few examples of physical systems whose inference and control will be enabled by the mathematical research proposed here are: plasma fusion, carbon sequestration, combustion engines, transportation, climate, power grids, subsurface contaminants, and advanced materials and manufacturing. Beyond DOE mission problems, the DT framework extends broadly across numerous scientific, engineering, medical, financial, and societal systems. While our work will be widely applicable, we have chosen two application testbeds spanning the spectrum of decision time scales to both drive our work and demonstrate the power of DTs: (1) a materials science testbed involving a DT for real-time control of self-assembling thin films and (2) a climate science testbed focused on a DT for coupled ice shelf-ocean cavity systems. Team, education, and mentoring. We have marshaled a team of leading authorities in data assimilation, optimization, optimal control, UQ, ROMs, DTs, statistical learning, ML, high performance computing, and coupled multiphysics modeling. Beyond the mathematical research proposed here, M2dt team members will parlay their roles as educators, mentors, and community leaders to deliver an extensive program of mentoring and outreach."

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools. The SW-IFL will specifically advance urban systems science by: (1) improving our understanding of how the built environment affects local to regional climates, emissions, and air chemistry; (2) establishing empirically-grounded theory of how governance, actors, plans, and policies across scales shape resilience to heat; (3) building a framework and simulation capability to facilitate equitable mitigation of extreme heat and its societal impacts via analysis of co-benefits and tradeoffs of sustainability outcomes; and (4) engaging stakeholders who represent many scales of government and the community in an advising and co-discovery role to drive the research process toward decision-relevant knowledge. Activities: Observations will leverage existing networks of weather, air quality, and hydrological measurements, supplementing available data with crucial new measurements of land-atmosphere exchange processes, atmospheric composition, and emissions. Intensive observational periods (IOP) throughout the summer months (from hot/arid pre-monsoon months throughout the peak of the North American monsoon season) will use mobile observatories to measure large-scale boundary-layer processes, and focused neighborhood-scale heavily-instrumented testbed experiments to elucidate drivers of microclimate variations and to evaluate the efficacy of proposed solutions. An open call to colleagues nationwide to bring additional unique instruments into the SW-IFL IOPs will be conducted. The testbed experiments will leverage data from the IOPs and include additional short- and long-term measurements that will engage researchers from across our university network as well as citizen scientists from our stakeholder organizations and the broader SW-IFL communities. Next generation predictive modeling capabilities for urban regions will be developed by improving representations of fine-scale physical processes, while coupling existing state-of-the-art models that integrate human behavior and atmospheric phenomena ranging from neighborhood to regional and global scales. The overall strategy for stakeholder engagement focuses on the co-creation of knowledge. This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities.

These gases are both air pollutants and greenhouse gas precursors. However, we do not know the specific microbial populations and genetic systems responsible for these emissions, making it challenging to predict their contributions to global atmospheric change. Additionally, the specific populations of microorganisms that produce these gases likely vary across ecosystems. Thus, forest ecosystems at different stages of mesophication provide a unique opportunity to study how different environmental factors like soil moisture and nutrient content influence microbial production of NOx/HONO. This research team will use a novel approach to investigate the microbial origins of these emissions across forests of varying mesophication stages. This new research is driven by several hypotheses: (1) Soil moisture and N are the primary drivers of microbial emissions of NOx/HONO in forest ecosystems. Both variables will increase alongside the degree of forest mesophication. (2) In mesic (i.e., moist) forest soils, higher N levels from more easily decomposed leaf litter and increased water runoff from trees contribute to greater NOx/HONO emissions. (3) The high moisture levels in these soil conditions create small oxygen-deprived zones where anaerobic microorganisms become the main source of NOx/HONO emissions. (4) Emissions from these microbial processes have a significant impact on regional air quality and atmospheric chemistry across the eastern United States. In Objective 1 of this project, the research team will study how biological, chemical, and physical factors affect the release of NO?/HONO from soils in forests with high to low degrees of mesophication. The team will focus on different forest plots at the Catoosa Wildlife Management Area (Crossville, TN, USA), which represent a variety of fire management practices\u2014ranging from no burns at all (i.e., mesic, or moist, conditions) to frequent, controlled burns (i.e., xeric, or drier, conditions). The team will analyze the soil microbial communities using DNA sequencing techniques and measure other factors such as soil moisture, N levels, and NO?/HONO emissions from the soil. They will also track the unique isotopic \"fingerprints\" of these gases (using nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18 isotopes) to determine their sources. In the laboratory, for Objective 2, the researchers will test soil samples taken from this study site to understand how past fire activity influences the release of NO?/HONO gases. In Objective 3, the team will measure the specific isotopic signatures (nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18) of the NO?/HONO gases produced by different types of microorganisms. This will help them identify the specific microbial processes responsible for producing these gases in the field. Finally, in Objective 4, the researchers will use these findings from Objectives 1-3 to build a biogeochemical model that estimates how much NO?/HONO is released from soils under different fire conditions. This model will feed into an atmospheric model to predict how these emissions will impact the climate of the region. Key outcomes of the research include a detailed analysis of soil microbial communities across forests experiencing different levels of fire suppression and resulting mesophication. The study will describe how changes in these microbial populations are connected to the release of NO?/HONO. Researchers will also determine how specific soil microbial processes, such as denitrification and nitrification, contribute to the production of these gases. Additionally, the team will create a computer model that incorporates isotope data to simulate how nitrogen cycles through the environment and estimate the natural emissions of NO?/HONO from forest soils at various stages of mesophication. Using these results, they will run simulations to understand how changes in fire management and microbial populations affect atmospheric chemistry and, ultimately, the climate. These findings will be important for both climate modeling and forest management, especially as forests in the eastern U.S. become increasingly dominated by mesic, fire-suppressed conditions."

Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures. We plan to use selective poisons and site blockers to help identify and quantify active sites and design doping (P, B, O, halogen) strategies to enhance the CNx activity/selectivity by changing the electronic structure around the active sites. We also plan to integrate a range of new in situ/operando experimental characterization techniques, consisting of near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), IR and Raman spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. To enable operando characterization, we will use custom built electrochemical cells designed in our labs to explore the surface restructuring under operating conditions. DFT will be used to assist in interpreting the spectroscopy by predicting XPS binding energy shifts along with adsorbate vibrational spectroscopy.

Ozkan, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Aravind Asthagiri, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) Anne Co, The Ohio State University (Co-investigator) The proposed work will undertake a systematic investigation of hetero-atom-doped carbon-based catalysts for low-temperature oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and bromine evolution reaction (BER) in acidic media. Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions. Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures. We plan to use selective poisons and site blockers to help identify and quantify active sites and design doping (P, B, O, halogen) strategies to enhance the CNx activity/selectivity by changing the electronic structure around the active sites. We also plan to integrate a range of new in situ/operando experimental characterization techniques, consisting of near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), IR and Raman spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. To enable operando characterization, we will use custom built electrochemical cells designed in our labs to explore the surface restructuring under operating conditions. DFT will be used to assist in interpreting the spectroscopy by predicting XPS binding energy shifts along with adsorbate vibrational spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic activity and selectivity testing combined with DFT predictions of activity for specific CNx models will establish refined structure-activity relationships.

Aim 2 is to make a \u201cmovie\u201d of the MCR mechanism by revealing the detailed structures of all substrate-bound and intermediate states in the catalytic cycle. We have developed a chemical toolbox for MCR studies including in-house synthesized native substrates and various substrate analogs designed to trap the proposed intermediates. We also will use an extensive instrumental toolbox consisting of structural biology, chemical synthesis, and kinetics coupled to spectroscopy. These experiments will be complemented by computational methods to determine transition state energies and electronic structures of the intermediates. This research plan is expected to provide the long-awaited structure of the active Ni(I) state of MCR and to capture and identify the intermediates and transition states for each step in the MCR mechanism. Our research program will also shed light on the proposed MCR mechanism of C-S and S-S bond activation and cleavage involving Ni(I)-sulfonate interaction and long-distance through-bond electron transfer. We expect the work described here to help guide the design of more efficient catalysts for the use of alkanes in industrial applications and active site directed methanogenesis inhibitors."

          "chunk_text": "In forests of the eastern United States, wildfire suppression policies have significantly changed the tree structure, soil composition, and moisture levels, a process known as \"mesophication\". \u201cMesic\u201d forest soils have increased moisture content and nutrient availability. These mesophication-associated changes are expected to have a major impact on soil nitrogen (N) cycling by microorganisms. Microorganisms involved in N-cycling in forest soils are major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO) to the atmosphere. These gases are both air pollutants and greenhouse gas precursors. However, we do not know the specific microbial populations and genetic systems responsible for these emissions, making it challenging to predict their contributions to global atmospheric change. Additionally, the specific populations of microorganisms that produce these gases likely vary across ecosystems. Thus, forest ecosystems at different stages of mesophication provide a unique opportunity to study how different environmental factors like soil moisture and nutrient content influence microbial production of NOx/HONO. This research team will use a novel approach to investigate the microbial origins of these emissions across forests of varying mesophication stages. This new research is driven by several hypotheses: (1) Soil moisture and N are the primary drivers of microbial emissions of NOx/HONO in forest ecosystems. Both variables will increase alongside the degree of forest mesophication. (2) In mesic (i.e., moist) forest soils, higher N levels from more easily decomposed leaf litter and increased water runoff from trees contribute to greater NOx/HONO emissions. (3) The high moisture levels in these soil conditions create small oxygen-deprived zones where anaerobic microorganisms become the main source of NOx/HONO emissions.

          "public_abstract": "In forests of the eastern United States, wildfire suppression policies have significantly changed the tree structure, soil composition, and moisture levels, a process known as \"mesophication\". \u201cMesic\u201d forest soils have increased moisture content and nutrient availability. These mesophication-associated changes are expected to have a major impact on soil nitrogen (N) cycling by microorganisms. Microorganisms involved in N-cycling in forest soils are major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO) to the atmosphere. These gases are both air pollutants and greenhouse gas precursors. However, we do not know the specific microbial populations and genetic systems responsible for these emissions, making it challenging to predict their contributions to global atmospheric change. Additionally, the specific populations of microorganisms that produce these gases likely vary across ecosystems. Thus, forest ecosystems at different stages of mesophication provide a unique opportunity to study how different environmental factors like soil moisture and nutrient content influence microbial production of NOx/HONO. This research team will use a novel approach to investigate the microbial origins of these emissions across forests of varying mesophication stages. This new research is driven by several hypotheses: (1) Soil moisture and N are the primary drivers of microbial emissions of NOx/HONO in forest ecosystems. Both variables will increase alongside the degree of forest mesophication. (2) In mesic (i.e., moist) forest soils, higher N levels from more easily decomposed leaf litter and increased water runoff from trees contribute to greater NOx/HONO emissions. (3) The high moisture levels in these soil conditions create small oxygen-deprived zones where anaerobic microorganisms become the main source of NOx/HONO emissions. (4) Emissions from these microbial processes have a significant impact on regional air quality and atmospheric chemistry across the eastern United States. In Objective 1 of this project, the research team will study how biological, chemical, and physical factors affect the release of NO?/HONO from soils in forests with high to low degrees of mesophication. The team will focus on different forest plots at the Catoosa Wildlife Management Area (Crossville, TN, USA), which represent a variety of fire management practices\u2014ranging from no burns at all (i.e., mesic, or moist, conditions) to frequent, controlled burns (i.e., xeric, or drier, conditions). The team will analyze the soil microbial communities using DNA sequencing techniques and measure other factors such as soil moisture, N levels, and NO?/HONO emissions from the soil. They will also track the unique isotopic \"fingerprints\" of these gases (using nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18 isotopes) to determine their sources. In the laboratory, for Objective 2, the researchers will test soil samples taken from this study site to understand how past fire activity influences the release of NO?/HONO gases. In Objective 3, the team will measure the specific isotopic signatures (nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18) of the NO?/HONO gases produced by different types of microorganisms. This will help them identify the specific microbial processes responsible for producing these gases in the field. Finally, in Objective 4, the researchers will use these findings from Objectives 1-3 to build a biogeochemical model that estimates how much NO?/HONO is released from soils under different fire conditions. This model will feed into an atmospheric model to predict how these emissions will impact the climate of the region. Key outcomes of the research include a detailed analysis of soil microbial communities across forests experiencing different levels of fire suppression and resulting mesophication. The study will describe how changes in these microbial populations are connected to the release of NO?/HONO. Researchers will also determine how specific soil microbial processes, such as denitrification and nitrification, contribute to the production of these gases. Additionally, the team will create a computer model that incorporates isotope data to simulate how nitrogen cycles through the environment and estimate the natural emissions of NO?/HONO from forest soils at various stages of mesophication. Using these results, they will run simulations to understand how changes in fire management and microbial populations affect atmospheric chemistry and, ultimately, the climate. These findings will be important for both climate modeling and forest management, especially as forests in the eastern U.S. become increasingly dominated by mesic, fire-suppressed conditions."

We have developed a chemical toolbox for MCR studies including in-house synthesized native substrates and various substrate analogs designed to trap the proposed intermediates. We also will use an extensive instrumental toolbox consisting of structural biology, chemical synthesis, and kinetics coupled to spectroscopy. These experiments will be complemented by computational methods to determine transition state energies and electronic structures of the intermediates. This research plan is expected to provide the long-awaited structure of the active Ni(I) state of MCR and to capture and identify the intermediates and transition states for each step in the MCR mechanism. Our research program will also shed light on the proposed MCR mechanism of C-S and S-S bond activation and cleavage involving Ni(I)-sulfonate interaction and long-distance through-bond electron transfer. We expect the work described here to help guide the design of more efficient catalysts for the use of alkanes in industrial applications and active site directed methanogenesis inhibitors."

The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions.

          "public_abstract": "In forests of the eastern United States, wildfire suppression policies have significantly changed the tree structure, soil composition, and moisture levels, a process known as \"mesophication\". \u201cMesic\u201d forest soils have increased moisture content and nutrient availability. These mesophication-associated changes are expected to have a major impact on soil nitrogen (N) cycling by microorganisms. Microorganisms involved in N-cycling in forest soils are major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO) to the atmosphere. These gases are both air pollutants and greenhouse gas precursors. However, we do not know the specific microbial populations and genetic systems responsible for these emissions, making it challenging to predict their contributions to global atmospheric change. Additionally, the specific populations of microorganisms that produce these gases likely vary across ecosystems. Thus, forest ecosystems at different stages of mesophication provide a unique opportunity to study how different environmental factors like soil moisture and nutrient content influence microbial production of NOx/HONO. This research team will use a novel approach to investigate the microbial origins of these emissions across forests of varying mesophication stages. This new research is driven by several hypotheses: (1) Soil moisture and N are the primary drivers of microbial emissions of NOx/HONO in forest ecosystems. Both variables will increase alongside the degree of forest mesophication. (2) In mesic (i.e., moist) forest soils, higher N levels from more easily decomposed leaf litter and increased water runoff from trees contribute to greater NOx/HONO emissions. (3) The high moisture levels in these soil conditions create small oxygen-deprived zones where anaerobic microorganisms become the main source of NOx/HONO emissions. (4) Emissions from these microbial processes have a significant impact on regional air quality and atmospheric chemistry across the eastern United States. In Objective 1 of this project, the research team will study how biological, chemical, and physical factors affect the release of NO?/HONO from soils in forests with high to low degrees of mesophication. The team will focus on different forest plots at the Catoosa Wildlife Management Area (Crossville, TN, USA), which represent a variety of fire management practices\u2014ranging from no burns at all (i.e., mesic, or moist, conditions) to frequent, controlled burns (i.e., xeric, or drier, conditions). The team will analyze the soil microbial communities using DNA sequencing techniques and measure other factors such as soil moisture, N levels, and NO?/HONO emissions from the soil. They will also track the unique isotopic \"fingerprints\" of these gases (using nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18 isotopes) to determine their sources. In the laboratory, for Objective 2, the researchers will test soil samples taken from this study site to understand how past fire activity influences the release of NO?/HONO gases. In Objective 3, the team will measure the specific isotopic signatures (nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18) of the NO?/HONO gases produced by different types of microorganisms. This will help them identify the specific microbial processes responsible for producing these gases in the field. Finally, in Objective 4, the researchers will use these findings from Objectives 1-3 to build a biogeochemical model that estimates how much NO?/HONO is released from soils under different fire conditions. This model will feed into an atmospheric model to predict how these emissions will impact the climate of the region. Key outcomes of the research include a detailed analysis of soil microbial communities across forests experiencing different levels of fire suppression and resulting mesophication. The study will describe how changes in these microbial populations are connected to the release of NO?/HONO. Researchers will also determine how specific soil microbial processes, such as denitrification and nitrification, contribute to the production of these gases. Additionally, the team will create a computer model that incorporates isotope data to simulate how nitrogen cycles through the environment and estimate the natural emissions of NO?/HONO from forest soils at various stages of mesophication. Using these results, they will run simulations to understand how changes in fire management and microbial populations affect atmospheric chemistry and, ultimately, the climate. These findings will be important for both climate modeling and forest management, especially as forests in the eastern U.S. become increasingly dominated by mesic, fire-suppressed conditions."

But the representativeness of these findings for the entire Southern Ocean is not known because data have been obtained in only a few locations and exhibit latitudinal trends and dependence on synoptic conditions. Thus, this project will use observations from the Cloud and Precipitation Experiment at kennaook (CAPE-k) project to examine controls on aerosol and cloud properties, including those of mixed-phase and ice clouds, over the Southern Ocean. Using CAPE-k data supplemented with data from the Measurements of Aerosols Radiation and Clouds over the Southern Ocean (MARCUS), Macquarie Island Cloud Radiation Experiment (MICRE), and Cold-Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) we will analyze how cloud, precipitation and radiative properties depend on season and on aerosol and meteorological conditions to test these hypotheses: 1) Given meteorological constraints, radiative biases in models are dominated by the representation of mixed-phase cloud processes over the Southern Ocean; 2) At similar surface temperatures and latitudes, systematic differences between Arctic and Southern Ocean clouds cloud properties exist and are more closely linked to environmental conditions than aerosol amount; 3) The concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei and aerosols are more correlated with precipitation presence than with surface wind speeds regardless of large scale meteorological conditions or geographic location; 4) Liquid, ice, and mixed-phase cloud and precipitation properties of boundary layer clouds are more closely correlated with cloud-base and mid-cloud updrafts and environmental conditions than to variations in accumulation mode aerosol concentrations; 5) The presence of ice in drizzle over the Southern Ocean is better correlated with cloud updraft velocity than with accumulation aerosol or ice nucleating particle concentrations; We will use data from in-situ aerosol, thermodynamic, meteorological, ground-based precipitation probes, radar, lidar, and radiometer sensors from CAPE-k and the kennaook station to derive and retrieve aerosol and cloud microphysical properties, heights, coverage and updraft speeds. We will develop a value-added product of environmental conditions including temperature, lower atmospheric stability, estimated inversion strength, cold air outbreak index, convective available potential energy, wind speed and direction, air mass origin, meteorological regime, cloud coupling to boundary layer, and closed/open cell classification. Multivariate statistical tests will determine significance of correlations between cloud, aerosol and dynamical properties and dependence on environmental conditions, and used to evaluate simulations. Simulations will examine how cloud, precipitation and radiative properties depend on the environment and aerosols, and explore how the representation of cloud microphysics, the boundary layer, and surface fluxes affects radiative fluxes in models at various scales using the DOE-supported models, Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Single Column Model (SCM) and Doubly Periodic Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model (DP-SCREAM). The implementation of ice multiplication processes in the Predicted Particle Properties (P3) microphysics scheme will be critical for determining controls on mixed-phase and ice-phase cloud properties."

Caravan2, Dr. Stephen J. Klippenstein2 1: Coastal Carolina University, Conway, SC 29526 2: Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL 60439 The objectives of this research are to implement innovative experimental and theoretical techniques to study the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals. Furthermore, the research aligns with the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) funding opportunity announcement goals by establishing a partnership between Argonne National Laboratory and Coastal Carolina University, a primarily undergraduate and emerging research institution. Peroxy radicals are reactive organic intermediates ubiquitous in the chemistry of oxygenated environments. The fate of peroxy radicals is highly dependent on the functionalization of the peroxy radical and the conditions of the local environment, such as temperature, pressure, and co-reactant concentrations. Hydrogen atom migration reactions are critical in the unimolecular decay of peroxy radicals: they impact the propensity for the recycling of hydroxyl radicals (an important oxidant), and play a central role in autoxidation, which leads to molecular weight growth and particle formation. Biomolecular reactions of peroxy radicals can compete with unimolecular decay, affecting tropospheric ozone concentrations and the formation of low-volatility molecules. The competition between peroxy radical reactivity between unimolecular decay and bimolecular reaction is sensitive to the rate of the hydrogen atom migration reactions, which highly depends on the functionalization of the peroxy radical. Recent theoretical investigations have shown that the H-atom migration rates of peroxy radicals with different functional groups can vary by as much as fifteen orders of magnitude. Such a vast range in unimolecular decay rates has potentially important implications for the relative importance of critical pathways in Earth's lower atmosphere and low-temperature combustion, such as autoxidation, particle formation, and autoignition. However, the predicted unimolecular decay rates of functionalized peroxy radical are largely uncharacterized due to experimental challenges.

These changes pose direct risks to current and future human generations, especially socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of these ecosystem changes, and what kinds of actions would improve outcomes, requires new collaborations that bring together researchers in physical and biological sciences to test hypotheses with landscape-scale experiments. Addressing these issues also compels strong and sustained investment in inclusive training for scientists representing all affected human communities. To meet these needs, this project will advance new and long-term partnerships between faculty and students at Western Colorado University and researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley and SLAC National Accelerator Labs, focusing on the meeting the two key objectives. First, we will develop collaborative research on climate-driven impacts to ecosystems and watershed system functionality, linking forests to floodplains in western Colorado. Second, we will create new educational opportunities that provide innovative training to diverse students through immersion in real-time research that can provide new knowledge essential to improved social and ecological outcomes. Over a four year timeframe, we will develop a suite of synergistic research activities linking current and planned DOE research in watershed function with Western\u2019s growing expertise in ecological and environmental sciences and engagement with land management agencies planning large-scale interventions.

Within the purview of the DOE-FAIR framework, this research project led by Rutgers University-Newark in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) will: (1) pinpoint the essential structural and electronic features that facilitate CO2 reduction catalysis with manganese (Mn) molecules; (2) utilize the advanced spectro-electrochemical equipment and expertise available at PNNL; (3) advance the understanding of Mn-based redox agents transfer electrons to CO2 by modulating reaction temperatures and pressures via specialized spectroscopic equipment available at PNNL; (4) use experimental and quantum chemical methodologies to map the energy landscapes of elementary reaction steps during the reactions involving Mn, CO2, and electrons. Unlocking new modes of reactivity with CO2 in this research program will contribute to a clean and secure energy future, cementing the United States as a global leader in sustainable chemistry and catalysis."

These mesophication-associated changes are expected to have a major impact on soil nitrogen (N) cycling by microorganisms. Microorganisms involved in N-cycling in forest soils are major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO) to the atmosphere. These gases are both air pollutants and greenhouse gas precursors. However, we do not know the specific microbial populations and genetic systems responsible for these emissions, making it challenging to predict their contributions to global atmospheric change. Additionally, the specific populations of microorganisms that produce these gases likely vary across ecosystems. Thus, forest ecosystems at different stages of mesophication provide a unique opportunity to study how different environmental factors like soil moisture and nutrient content influence microbial production of NOx/HONO. This research team will use a novel approach to investigate the microbial origins of these emissions across forests of varying mesophication stages. This new research is driven by several hypotheses: (1) Soil moisture and N are the primary drivers of microbial emissions of NOx/HONO in forest ecosystems. Both variables will increase alongside the degree of forest mesophication. (2) In mesic (i.e., moist) forest soils, higher N levels from more easily decomposed leaf litter and increased water runoff from trees contribute to greater NOx/HONO emissions.

The team will analyze the soil microbial communities using DNA sequencing techniques and measure other factors such as soil moisture, N levels, and NO?/HONO emissions from the soil. They will also track the unique isotopic \"fingerprints\" of these gases (using nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18 isotopes) to determine their sources. In the laboratory, for Objective 2, the researchers will test soil samples taken from this study site to understand how past fire activity influences the release of NO?/HONO gases. In Objective 3, the team will measure the specific isotopic signatures (nitrogen-15 and oxygen-18) of the NO?/HONO gases produced by different types of microorganisms. This will help them identify the specific microbial processes responsible for producing these gases in the field. Finally, in Objective 4, the researchers will use these findings from Objectives 1-3 to build a biogeochemical model that estimates how much NO?/HONO is released from soils under different fire conditions. This model will feed into an atmospheric model to predict how these emissions will impact the climate of the region. Key outcomes of the research include a detailed analysis of soil microbial communities across forests experiencing different levels of fire suppression and resulting mesophication. The study will describe how changes in these microbial populations are connected to the release of NO?/HONO. Researchers will also determine how specific soil microbial processes, such as denitrification and nitrification, contribute to the production of these gases. Additionally, the team will create a computer model that incorporates isotope data to simulate how nitrogen cycles through the environment and estimate the natural emissions of NO?/HONO from forest soils at various stages of mesophication. Using these results, they will run simulations to understand how changes in fire management and microbial populations affect atmospheric chemistry and, ultimately, the climate. These findings will be important for both climate modeling and forest management, especially as forests in the eastern U.S. become increasingly dominated by mesic, fire-suppressed conditions."

MCR catalyzes the formation of methane and the heterodisulfide, CoB-S-S-CoM, from methyl-Coenzyme M (methyl-CoM) and Coenzyme B (CoB). Prior work in the PI\u2019s lab has optimized strategies to obtain high yields of the active Ni(I) state of highly oxygen-sensitive MCR, revealed its strictly ordered ternary complex mechanism of binding substrates, and demonstrated that a methyl radical along with thiyl and disulfide anion radicals form during catalysis. We have also described a novel sulfonate-Ni(I) mode by which MCR binds its first substrate methyl-CoM and determined the first room-temperature structure of this enzyme. During the next three-year contract, we will use a wide swath of approaches to fill many of the remaining gaps in understanding the MCR mechanism. Aim 1 is to reveal the structure of the active Ni(I) state of MCR using complementary methods: X-ray free electron laser serial crystallography (XFEL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and neutron diffraction. XFEL is known to produce physiologically relevant damage-free high-resolution structures of sub-micron crystals. Our recent structural results indicate that the inactive Ni(II)-state of MCR is a \u201clocked-in\u201d relatively \u201cfrozen\u201d state, while the active Ni(I) form of MCR is a highly dynamic molecule with a pentacoordinate Ni(I) active site. We have optimized conditions for XFEL measurements, as well as incorporating methods to simultaneously validate the Ni redox state. We also optimized conditions and will determine the Ni(I)-MCR structure by complementary XRD and neutron diffraction methods. To obtain detailed electronic and geometric structural information of the Ni(I) protein and active site, the crystals and concentrated solutions will be analyzed in parallel by spectroscopic and kinetic methods. Aim 2 is to make a \u201cmovie\u201d of the MCR mechanism by revealing the detailed structures of all substrate-bound and intermediate states in the catalytic cycle. We have developed a chemical toolbox for MCR studies including in-house synthesized native substrates and various substrate analogs designed to trap the proposed intermediates. We also will use an extensive instrumental toolbox consisting of structural biology, chemical synthesis, and kinetics coupled to spectroscopy. These experiments will be complemented by computational methods to determine transition state energies and electronic structures of the intermediates. This research plan is expected to provide the long-awaited structure of the active Ni(I) state of MCR and to capture and identify the intermediates and transition states for each step in the MCR mechanism. Our research program will also shed light on the proposed MCR mechanism of C-S and S-S bond activation and cleavage involving Ni(I)-sulfonate interaction and long-distance through-bond electron transfer. We expect the work described here to help guide the design of more efficient catalysts for the use of alkanes in industrial applications and active site directed methanogenesis inhibitors."

          "public_abstract": "This project focuses on liquid water, a critical material shaping geochemistry and life on our planet. The overarching goal is to understand how water adopts distinct properties when placed in contact with different surfaces. Key surfaces examined are clay minerals and related solids (e.g., mica) that play central roles in soil health and subsurface energy, including in soil resilience to erosion and drought, geologic CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste isolation, and enhanced geothermal energy. The approach followed in the project uses high-performance computing, supported by atomistic-level experimental characterization, to elucidate the nanoscale properties of water in clay interlayer nanopores and in adsorbed water films on mica and silica surfaces. In particular, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to reveal the behavior of individual atoms in complex systems (where spectroscopic and other experimental methods probe the average behavior of large numbers of atoms or molecules) and the manner in which the collective properties of assemblages of millions of water molecules emerge from atomistic-level interactions. A first major focus of the project is on understanding the selective transport properties of water-filled nanopores. In other words, how do nanopores selectively transport water vs. salt, or cations vs. anions? A second major focus is on understanding the stability of adsorbed water films on mineral surfaces. Finally, a third focus is on advancing MD simulation capabilities by combining simulations with synchrotron X-ray reflectivity and Terahertz spectroscopy experiments. The research relies on simulations carried out at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a US Department of Energy facility located at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and on Princeton University\u2019s high-performance computing clusters. The project involves collaborations with scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the University of Ruhr-Bochum. A key projected outcome is the critical re-examination of existing models and theories used to describe the properties of water in nanopores and thin films, including models of water and solute transport in nanopores and models of disjoining pressure in adsorbed water films. Beyond the Geosciences, this research aims to generate fundamental scientific knowledge relevant to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes; wettability and multiphase flow; chemical synthesis using interfacial or confined water as a green solvent; and other scientific areas. Finally, the project aims to accelerate the development of advanced nanogeochemical experimental approaches for the characterization of geologic media and processes, including Terahertz spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity experiments."

          "public_abstract": "In forests of the eastern United States, wildfire suppression policies have significantly changed the tree structure, soil composition, and moisture levels, a process known as \"mesophication\". \u201cMesic\u201d forest soils have increased moisture content and nutrient availability. These mesophication-associated changes are expected to have a major impact on soil nitrogen (N) cycling by microorganisms. Microorganisms involved in N-cycling in forest soils are major sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO) to the atmosphere. These gases are both air pollutants and greenhouse gas precursors. However, we do not know the specific microbial populations and genetic systems responsible for these emissions, making it challenging to predict their contributions to global atmospheric change. Additionally, the specific populations of microorganisms that produce these gases likely vary across ecosystems. Thus, forest ecosystems at different stages of mesophication provide a unique opportunity to study how different environmental factors like soil moisture and nutrient content influence microbial production of NOx/HONO. This research team will use a novel approach to investigate the microbial origins of these emissions across forests of varying mesophication stages. This new research is driven by several hypotheses: (1) Soil moisture and N are the primary drivers of microbial emissions of NOx/HONO in forest ecosystems. Both variables will increase alongside the degree of forest mesophication. (2) In mesic (i.e., moist) forest soils, higher N levels from more easily decomposed leaf litter and increased water runoff from trees contribute to greater NOx/HONO emissions. (3) The high moisture levels in these soil conditions create small oxygen-deprived zones where anaerobic microorganisms become the main source of NOx/HONO emissions. (4) Emissions from these microbial processes have a significant impact on regional air quality and atmospheric chemistry across the eastern United States. In Objective 1 of this project, the research team will study how biological, chemical, and physical factors affect the release of NO?/HONO from soils in forests with high to low degrees of mesophication. The team will focus on different forest plots at the Catoosa Wildlife Management Area (Crossville, TN, USA), which represent a variety of fire management practices\u2014ranging from no burns at all (i.e., mesic, or moist, conditions) to frequent, controlled burns (i.e., xeric, or drier, conditions).

These changes pose direct risks to current and future human generations, especially socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of these ecosystem changes, and what kinds of actions would improve outcomes, requires new collaborations that bring together researchers in physical and biological sciences to test hypotheses with landscape-scale experiments. Addressing these issues also compels strong and sustained investment in inclusive training for scientists representing all affected human communities. To meet these needs, this project will advance new and long-term partnerships between faculty and students at Western Colorado University and researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley and SLAC National Accelerator Labs, focusing on the meeting the two key objectives. First, we will develop collaborative research on climate-driven impacts to ecosystems and watershed system functionality, linking forests to floodplains in western Colorado. Second, we will create new educational opportunities that provide innovative training to diverse students through immersion in real-time research that can provide new knowledge essential to improved social and ecological outcomes. Over a four year timeframe, we will develop a suite of synergistic research activities linking current and planned DOE research in watershed function with Western\u2019s growing expertise in ecological and environmental sciences and engagement with land management agencies planning large-scale interventions. Together, these endeavors will allow us to test hypotheses around effects of disturbances such as fire, novel silvicultural treatments, and stream restoration, on ecosystem function under a changing climate.

We will utilize deep learning (DL) to improve plant trait parameterization for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM) coupled to a next-generation dynamic vegetation model, the Functionally Assembled TErrestrial Simulator (FATES). The project seeks to understand (i) how soil, topography, and other environmental variables influence plant hydraulics, growth, and mortality parameters; (ii) relative importance and uncertainty sources of these parameters; and (iii) characteristics of plant hydraulic parameters, such as time-dependence and identifiability. Building on our previous and preliminary work, a major contribution of the research is a novel and highly efficient parameter learning framework for estimating environment-dependent and scale-dependent vegetation trait parameters with uncertainty estimations. This framework, saving four orders-of-magnitude of computational time, can be applied instantly on large scales, and has very competitive and potentially stronger optimization metrics than current optimization algorithms. It can be said that, instead of solving one inversion problem at a time, our framework will train a tool that solves this problem with higher efficient and more robust results. Additionally, this framework opens fresh pathways to address issues and ask new questions from a data-driven perspective. We will reduce uncertainty and improve physical significance of parameters by imposing novel constraints, such as information-transfer (parameters are roughly functions of plant types and environmental covariates) and covariation (exploiting observed inter-parameter relationships). At the same time, local heterogeneities in traits can be expressed, allowing us to understand the relative importance of stochasticity and environmental controls of plant traits. By interrogating the trained parameter learning model, we will reveal the linkages between topography, grid scale, soil, climate, and plant hydraulic traits, growth, and mortality parameters.

          "public_abstract": "Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) Rationale: The growing urban megaregion across the state of Arizona is experiencing stresses resulting from a warming climate and population growth. This region contains one of the fastest growing urban corridors in the US, including major cities of Tucson, Phoenix, and Flagstaff. With most of the region\u2019s urban areas routinely experiencing 30+ days of temperatures above 110 \u00b0F each summer, the population is stressed by the complex interactions of extreme heat, atmospheric pollutants, and limited water. Stretching from the Mexican border in the south to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) Nation in the north, the region experiences disproportionate impacts on vulnerable urban subpopulations. Decision-ready knowledge is insufficient and often unavailable to mobilize specific action in places affected simultaneously by profound climate change and rapid growth. Vision: The Southwest Urban Corridor Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL) seeks to engage stakeholders and provide scientists and decision makers with high-quality, relevant knowledge capable of spurring and guiding responses to environmental concerns. The SW-IFL is a partnership involving the three public universities in Arizona, two national laboratories, and industry. Arizona State University leads a team that includes University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and IBM. Our initial stakeholder network includes six city governments, multiple county-level agencies, community groups, and local non-profits throughout the region. Novelty: The SW-IFL will develop and deploy novel observational and modeling capabilities that improve understanding of extreme heat as a central driver of key environmental outcomes, including greenhouse gas emissions, urban water stress, and fate and transport of urban air pollutants in the complex Arizona megaregion. The integration of new observations with innovations in coupled models across scales will enable high resolution modeling and the development of sophisticated decision-support tools.

This will include the development of integrative research and learning experiences through (a) scholar-community cohort fellowships, (b) undergraduate summer \u201cHeatMappers\u201d experiences with participatory science, and (c) K-12 curricular activities. Expected Outcomes: The integration of high-resolution observations (atmospheric, land surface, and infrastructure), diagnostic and predictive models, and civic engagement will provide new knowledge and deliver next-generation predictive tools that are regionally specific but also translatable to other arid regions. Ultimately, the new tools will empower the public to respond to extreme heat, while informing the development and deployment of policies and solutions that are effective, equitable and generalizable."

          "public_abstract": "This project will determine translations between adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) through the study of entanglement generation and its relation to computational hardness and optimal algorithmic design. The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC. This project will exploit the significant recent progress of quantum many-body physics to elucidate connections between two extensively studied models for quantum computation. Albeit intimately related, little is known about the correspondence between AQC and QAOA in regards to computational hardness and algorithmic design. Our study will provide important, broadly relevant details about these properties by (1) using entanglement growth as a proxy for problem hardness and (2) focusing on a computational problem class of practical relevance. Our work has the potential to impact quantum approaches to solving scientific problems of interest to DOE. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to inform the design and training of variational algorithms more generally, thus, extending the applicability to the variational quantum eigensolver and electronic structure calculations. In addition, our work could assist in circumventing barren plateaus, where optimal AQC schedules are used to provide near-optimal initial conditions when training large variational algorithms. More broadly, our work can supply intuition into the potential utility of a particular quantum computing model based on the specifications of the computational problem. As a result, the need for extensive empirical benchmarking utilizing costly classical and quantum computational resources could be reduced."

In high energy physics, there are many important problems which are likely to only be solvable with sufficiently advanced quantum simulations. Chief among these are problems related to understanding the dynamical properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the strong nuclear force responsible for the structure of nuclei. To use quantum computers effectively as a tool for studying QCD will require significant research investment into different methods for modeling QCD on quantum hardware; developing classical computing tools to support the quantum simulation; and devising efficient quantum algorithms to make the most of finite resources. This grant will support research along each of these axes, building the knowledge base and infrastructure to enable groundbreaking applications of quantum simulations to high energy physics as quantum technology evolves."

Cheng, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Co-Investigator) The proposed research will develop and deploy Quantum Digital Twins (QDT), hardware emulators that are individual digital clones of existing quantum devises. The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework. A key feature of our QDTs is the bi-directional interaction between virtual and physical siblings. In a calibration phase, a QDT\u2019s performance is monitored and improved in a cost-efficient way by optimal experimental design. When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products.

          "public_abstract": "Recent empirical demonstrations pointing toward quantum advantage have fueled excitement and growth in the field. However, many high-profile demonstrations suggesting quantum advantage have prompted improvements in classical algorithm design (e.g., tensor-network methods) and enlist additional classical resources (e.g., supercomputing) with surprising progress in closing quantum-advantage gaps. While quantum-inspired classical improvements are a healthy benefit of quantum-computing research, to ultimately realize quantum utility it is important to systematically identify, understand, and publicize sources of quantum advantage that are unlikely to be diminished as classical computing progresses. A demonstration of quantum utility may conjure the image of a plot indicating that a quantum computer performs better (with respect to some metric) than the best-known classical counterparts. This basic concept of quantum utility raises natural questions. Soundness: What evidence do we have that a quantum computer will continue to be the best way to solve this problem as input instances grow larger or more complex? Cost-effectiveness: Will a quantum computer be the most cost-effective way to solve the problem? Resource efficiency: Will some other resource considerations, such as energy to solution, rule out practical adoption of the quantum computing solution? While well-conceived notions of quantum utility have been suggested, none, to our knowledge, simultaneously take all of the above into account. Our goal is to identify sources of sustainable quantum utility, those that are sound, cost effective, and resource efficient. We believe that sustainable quantum utility is the best candidate for realizing the promise of quantum computing. We aim to discover examples of sustainable quantum utility through three guiding perspectives: (1) sustainable quantum utility should be backed by strong evidence or proof of asymptotic advantage \u2014 in other words, there should be some feature of quantum mechanics that continues to provide an advantage in a reasonably predictable manner as problem instances grow in size or complexity, (2) an array of resources beyond execution time should be considered to ensure that quantum advantages are indeed practical and that we are not overlooking unconventional quantum advantages, and (3) we should focus on developing quantum advantages for fundamental problems in broad domains such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning, that can be tailored to yield sustainable quantum utility for new and existing applications. While a major barrier to sustainable quantum utility is the current lack of mature, scalable, and error-resilient quantum computing hardware, sustainable quantum utility is also hampered by equally formidable fundamental algorithmic challenges. We address such algorithmic challenges by (1) developing unconventional quantum computing models, algorithms, and advantages that consider other computational resource bottlenecks, including running time, space/memory, solution accuracy, energy expenditure, and communication costs; (2) targeting basic scientific problems that are critical components in broad applications, such as simulating quantum systems and solving differential equations, linear systems, and continuous and discrete optimization problems; and (3) engaging in the full-stack-aware design of quantum algorithms that adjust computing-stack components to pave the way to unconventional demonstrations of sustainable quantum utility."

          "public_abstract": "Recent empirical demonstrations pointing toward quantum advantage have fueled excitement and growth in the field. However, many high-profile demonstrations suggesting quantum advantage have prompted improvements in classical algorithm design (e.g., tensor-network methods) and enlist additional classical resources (e.g., supercomputing) with surprising progress in closing quantum-advantage gaps. While quantum-inspired classical improvements are a healthy benefit of quantum-computing research, to ultimately realize quantum utility it is important to systematically identify, understand, and publicize sources of quantum advantage that are unlikely to be diminished as classical computing progresses. A demonstration of quantum utility may conjure the image of a plot indicating that a quantum computer performs better (with respect to some metric) than the best-known classical counterparts. This basic concept of quantum utility raises natural questions. Soundness: What evidence do we have that a quantum computer will continue to be the best way to solve this problem as input instances grow larger or more complex? Cost-effectiveness: Will a quantum computer be the most cost-effective way to solve the problem? Resource efficiency: Will some other resource considerations, such as energy to solution, rule out practical adoption of the quantum computing solution? While well-conceived notions of quantum utility have been suggested, none, to our knowledge, simultaneously take all of the above into account. Our goal is to identify sources of sustainable quantum utility, those that are sound, cost effective, and resource efficient. We believe that sustainable quantum utility is the best candidate for realizing the promise of quantum computing. We aim to discover examples of sustainable quantum utility through three guiding perspectives: (1) sustainable quantum utility should be backed by strong evidence or proof of asymptotic advantage \u2014 in other words, there should be some feature of quantum mechanics that continues to provide an advantage in a reasonably predictable manner as problem instances grow in size or complexity, (2) an array of resources beyond execution time should be considered to ensure that quantum advantages are indeed practical and that we are not overlooking unconventional quantum advantages, and (3) we should focus on developing quantum advantages for fundamental problems in broad domains such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning, that can be tailored to yield sustainable quantum utility for new and existing applications. While a major barrier to sustainable quantum utility is the current lack of mature, scalable, and error-resilient quantum computing hardware, sustainable quantum utility is also hampered by equally formidable fundamental algorithmic challenges. We address such algorithmic challenges by (1) developing unconventional quantum computing models, algorithms, and advantages that consider other computational resource bottlenecks, including running time, space/memory, solution accuracy, energy expenditure, and communication costs; (2) targeting basic scientific problems that are critical components in broad applications, such as simulating quantum systems and solving differential equations, linear systems, and continuous and discrete optimization problems; and (3) engaging in the full-stack-aware design of quantum algorithms that adjust computing-stack components to pave the way to unconventional demonstrations of sustainable quantum utility."

The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC. This project will exploit the significant recent progress of quantum many-body physics to elucidate connections between two extensively studied models for quantum computation.

Cheng, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Co-Investigator) The proposed research will develop and deploy Quantum Digital Twins (QDT), hardware emulators that are individual digital clones of existing quantum devises. The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework. A key feature of our QDTs is the bi-directional interaction between virtual and physical siblings. In a calibration phase, a QDT\u2019s performance is monitored and improved in a cost-efficient way by optimal experimental design. When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products. Our research has the potential to influence quantum computing methods for addressing scientific challenges relevant to the DOE. Our work can provide valuable intuition regarding the utility of specific quantum computing hardware. Additionally, the insights gained from this study can guide the design and training of general digital twins, thereby broadening their applicability to applications of relevance to the DOE."

          "public_abstract": "Recent empirical demonstrations pointing toward quantum advantage have fueled excitement and growth in the field. However, many high-profile demonstrations suggesting quantum advantage have prompted improvements in classical algorithm design (e.g., tensor-network methods) and enlist additional classical resources (e.g., supercomputing) with surprising progress in closing quantum-advantage gaps. While quantum-inspired classical improvements are a healthy benefit of quantum-computing research, to ultimately realize quantum utility it is important to systematically identify, understand, and publicize sources of quantum advantage that are unlikely to be diminished as classical computing progresses. A demonstration of quantum utility may conjure the image of a plot indicating that a quantum computer performs better (with respect to some metric) than the best-known classical counterparts. This basic concept of quantum utility raises natural questions. Soundness: What evidence do we have that a quantum computer will continue to be the best way to solve this problem as input instances grow larger or more complex? Cost-effectiveness: Will a quantum computer be the most cost-effective way to solve the problem? Resource efficiency: Will some other resource considerations, such as energy to solution, rule out practical adoption of the quantum computing solution? While well-conceived notions of quantum utility have been suggested, none, to our knowledge, simultaneously take all of the above into account. Our goal is to identify sources of sustainable quantum utility, those that are sound, cost effective, and resource efficient. We believe that sustainable quantum utility is the best candidate for realizing the promise of quantum computing. We aim to discover examples of sustainable quantum utility through three guiding perspectives: (1) sustainable quantum utility should be backed by strong evidence or proof of asymptotic advantage \u2014 in other words, there should be some feature of quantum mechanics that continues to provide an advantage in a reasonably predictable manner as problem instances grow in size or complexity, (2) an array of resources beyond execution time should be considered to ensure that quantum advantages are indeed practical and that we are not overlooking unconventional quantum advantages, and (3) we should focus on developing quantum advantages for fundamental problems in broad domains such as simulation, optimization, and machine learning, that can be tailored to yield sustainable quantum utility for new and existing applications. While a major barrier to sustainable quantum utility is the current lack of mature, scalable, and error-resilient quantum computing hardware, sustainable quantum utility is also hampered by equally formidable fundamental algorithmic challenges. We address such algorithmic challenges by (1) developing unconventional quantum computing models, algorithms, and advantages that consider other computational resource bottlenecks, including running time, space/memory, solution accuracy, energy expenditure, and communication costs; (2) targeting basic scientific problems that are critical components in broad applications, such as simulating quantum systems and solving differential equations, linear systems, and continuous and discrete optimization problems; and (3) engaging in the full-stack-aware design of quantum algorithms that adjust computing-stack components to pave the way to unconventional demonstrations of sustainable quantum utility."

The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC. This project will exploit the significant recent progress of quantum many-body physics to elucidate connections between two extensively studied models for quantum computation.

Cheng, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Co-Investigator) The proposed research will develop and deploy Quantum Digital Twins (QDT), hardware emulators that are individual digital clones of existing quantum devises. The QDT framework we propose will provide the foundational glue that binds currently available software tools, data, and hardware. We consider general hardware descriptions whose properties can be modeled by the Lindblad quantum master equation but note that other models are allowed by our QDT framework. A key feature of our QDTs is the bi-directional interaction between virtual and physical siblings. In a calibration phase, a QDT\u2019s performance is monitored and improved in a cost-efficient way by optimal experimental design. When calibrated, the QDT can be used to test any software on the quantum software stack that uses the hardware the QDT emulates. The QDTs will be realized by robust optimal transport-driven Bayesian techniques and novel, scalable numerical methods. The QDT emulators integrate the physics of quantum hardware, described by Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s and Lindblad\u2019s equations, using high-order accurate and structure-preserving numerical techniques. They also address the inherent complexity and incompleteness of these descriptions, known as model inadequacy, by employing robust Bayesian techniques that handle the inherent uncertainty and noise in the quantum hardware. The research program proposes to address the limitations of traditional approaches through four specific aims. The first aim is to design, analyze, and implement QDTs and algorithms using a Quantum Bi-directional Communication (QuBiC) approach. This approach first focuses on characterization tasks, employing optimal design of experiments, real quantum measurements, and statistical techniques driven by optimal transport. The second aim is to use the QuBiC approach for the optimal control tasks during the calibration phase of the QDT. This will be achieved through new arbitrary order accurate Hermite interpolation-based methods for time evolution and discrete adjoint computations, which will enable large speedups for problems of medium size. The third aim is to develop low-rank methods for Lindblad\u2019s quantum master equations to emulate large composite open systems. The final aim is to demonstrate and disseminate the QuBiC-enhanced QDTs by hardening developed algorithms and methods into existing open-source software products.

The objective of this study is to draw on our team's expertise in out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics, entanglement in ground states of Hamiltonians, and optimal control to establish connections between quantum problem hardness in QAOA and AQC and develop effective ways to translate optimal controls between these computational models. The project will be split into two thrust areas focusing on quantifying entanglement in QAOA and AQC and establishing translations of optimal computation across these models. Thrust 1 will focus on identifying universal properties of entanglement growth in QAOA by examining the dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropy. We will investigate the dependence of entanglement entropy on the choice of ansatze as well as its growth during training and after optimization. Our study will utilize numerical simulation and analytical techniques drawn from out-of-equilibrium quench dynamics to shed light on entanglement growth and its relationship to the specifications of the computational problem of interest; our focus will be on Maximum Satisfiability, where the clause density directly relates to the classical computational hardness of the problem. This problem class will further facilitate studies of interplay between classical and quantum hardness, entanglement growth, and computational models. The results of Thrust 1 will inform the design of optimal QAOA parameter selection and AQC schedules in Thrust 2. Using our team\u2019s extensive knowledge in control theory, we will develop guiding principles to translate between optimal AQC and QAOA based on the desired entanglement dynamics of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will exploit characteristics of each algorithm to inform the design of optimized controls for the other, e.g., AQC runtime will inform the QAOA depth and the optimized AQC path will be examined as an initialization for QAOA. Similar translations will be made for AQC, where QAOA paths will inform diabatic variants of AQC. This project will exploit the significant recent progress of quantum many-body physics to elucidate connections between two extensively studied models for quantum computation. Albeit intimately related, little is known about the correspondence between AQC and QAOA in regards to computational hardness and algorithmic design.
